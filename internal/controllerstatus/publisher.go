// Package controllerstatus publishes what the controller has actually read and
// decided, as one ConfigMap in its own namespace, so tools and operators can
// confirm a policy write without reading the controller's log.
//
// # Data contract
//
// The ConfigMap is named wva-controller-status (ConfigMapName), lives in the
// controller's namespace (POD_NAMESPACE), and carries the labels
// app.kubernetes.io/name=workload-variant-autoscaler and
// app.kubernetes.io/component=controller-status. Every value is a string:
//
//	formatVersion          "1". Bumped only for an incompatible change to
//	                       these keys.
//	policyNamespace        the namespace whose scaling-policy ConfigMap is the
//	                       cluster policy: the one limiters and the optimizer
//	                       are read from.
//	policyConfigMap        that ConfigMap's name.
//	policyResourceVersion  metadata.resourceVersion of the policy ConfigMap the
//	                       controller last LOADED, accepted or rejected. Written
//	                       only after that content is applied in memory, so a
//	                       reader that wrote version V and reads V here knows
//	                       the controller is running with it. Empty when no
//	                       policy ConfigMap is in force (none exists, or it was
//	                       deleted). Compare for equality, not order:
//	                       resourceVersions are opaque.
//	policyAccepted         "true", or "false" when the ConfigMap's "default"
//	                       entry was rejected; the controller then keeps the
//	                       "default" entry previously in force, or runs
//	                       without one when there was none.
//	policyError            why the "default" entry was rejected; empty when
//	                       accepted.
//	policyIgnored          the fields of the "default" entry in the controller's
//	                       OWN scaling-policy ConfigMap that were ignored
//	                       because their value cannot be used, as
//	                       <namespace>/<name>: then each field as
//	                       <field>="<value>": <reason>, joined by "; ". Values
//	                       are cut to 64 bytes and at most 10 fields listed,
//	                       then "+<n> more". The entry still applies and those
//	                       fields act as unset. Empty when none. It describes
//	                       the entry parsed in the latest read only: when that
//	                       entry is rejected and the previous one kept, it is
//	                       empty and policyAccepted/policyError say why. That
//	                       ConfigMap is where the fields
//	                       that can be ignored (scale-to-zero retention, the
//	                       shape-change hold) are read. With a separate policy
//	                       namespace it is not the one policyConfigMap names,
//	                       and the policy namespace's own ignored fields are
//	                       not listed: they are not read there at all.
//	limiter                the limiter in force, "<mode>/<entry names>": for
//	                       example "quota/install-quota",
//	                       "inventory/gpu-inventory", or "none".
//	limiterWarnings        what is wrong with the limiters in force though
//	                       they still apply as written, joined by "; ": a
//	                       quota entry named one of the reserved limiter
//	                       names, which a later release rejects. Empty when
//	                       none.
//	utilizationShare       the optimizer's mode: off, invalid, shadow or
//	                       active.
//	utilizationShareError  the optimizer block's configuration error when the
//	                       mode is invalid; empty otherwise.
//	leader                 the pod that wrote this: POD_NAME, else the
//	                       hostname.
//	controllerInstance     the controller_instance metrics label, when set.
//	limiterBudgets         the GPU budget the steady-state engine used in its
//	                       last cycle, JSON (LimiterBudgets); absent until a
//	                       cycle with a limiter. See KeyLimiterBudgets.
//	clusterQuotaPerController
//	                       present while a namespace-scoped controller
//	                       enforces a scope: cluster quota: the warning
//	                       (config.ClusterQuotaPerControllerMessage). That
//	                       quota caps this controller only; absent otherwise.
//	podListDenied          present while the GPU usage walk of a
//	                       namespace-scoped controller is refused a
//	                       cluster-wide Pod list and a physical limiter reads
//	                       it: GPUs other namespaces hold on the same nodes
//	                       count as free. Mirrors wva_pod_access_denied;
//	                       absent otherwise.
//	utilizationShareNote   present while the optimizer's settings in force
//	                       differ from its block as written: a namespace-scoped
//	                       controller with no quota on its namespace ignores
//	                       physicalGroups and says so here. The mode is not
//	                       invalid; absent otherwise.
//	inFlightLedger         the in-flight node ledger, JSON
//	                       (allocation.PersistedInFlight): the holes held for
//	                       replicas whose pods hold no node yet, each with its
//	                       expiry. State, not status: the steady-state engine
//	                       reads it back after a restart, and a new term
//	                       carries it over. See KeyInFlightLedger.
//
// limiter, limiterWarnings and utilizationShare are recomputed from the applied configuration
// in the same update that records policyResourceVersion, so they never lag
// it. The steady-state engine republishes utilizationShare every cycle as a
// backstop; the ConfigMap is rewritten only when a value changes.
//
// # Writing
//
// Only the elected leader writes: Publisher is a manager Runnable that needs
// leader election, so a standby keeps the state in memory and writes it the
// moment it is elected. Content carries no timestamp that moves on its own
// (limiterBudgets' asOf moves only with its figures), and a write happens only
// when the content differs from what this process last wrote, so a quiet
// controller does not write at all. A failed write -- Forbidden included -- is
// logged and retried with backoff; it never stops the controller.
