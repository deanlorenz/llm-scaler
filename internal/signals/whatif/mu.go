// The demand floor's mu is a request rate, and a request rate is not a property
// of a replica -- it is a property of a replica AND a shape. One replica
// generating G tokens a second completes G/O requests a second, so halving the
// generation length doubles mu with nothing about the hardware having changed.
// Measuring that per output-length bucket is a workaround for the units, and it
// cannot be made to work: the reading is only taken while a replica is
// saturated, and a fleet over-provisioned for the shape it has just moved to
// never saturates, so it never prices that shape.
//
// Measured on the 1k/6000 -> 8k/1000 swap of 2026-09-23. Nineteen minutes after
// the switch not one reading had been taken in the bucket the fleet was
// serving, and the floor was still pricing 6 req/s against the 6000-token
// phase's figure. Which figure it inherited was luck: 1.2754 on that run
// against 1.5429 on the one before, implying 4.70 and 3.89 replicas from an
// identical workload. The fleet held 7 while occupancy read a utilization
// of 0.028.
//
// Derived instead, over the model the throughput analyzer already fits and
// signals/itl now carries the arithmetic for:
//
//	muTok = itl.TokenRate(model, kSat, C, KVreq)   tokens/s at saturation
//	muReq = muTok / O                              what the floor prices with
//
// Nothing in it is keyed by a bucket and nothing waits for a saturated cycle:
// (A, B) is fitted from (k, ITL) pairs a replica reports at ANY load, and I
// and O are this cycle's own shape. A shape change reprices the fleet on the
// cycle it is observed rather than whenever the fleet next happens to saturate.
//
// It reproduces a measurement it was never given, which is the reason to
// believe it: on the trace's first shape it derives 1.487 req/s where the fleet
// measured 1.4292 and 1.5429 for itself, and on the second -- which the fleet
// never measured at all -- 4.200 req/s, asking for 1.43 replicas at the 6 req/s
// arriving. Occupancy independently said one.
//
// docs/proposals/shape-shift-treatment.md sets this out in full.

// --max-total-tokens to the memory it actually has, so a flag it could not
// honour over-states C, which over-states the resident sequence count, which

// PricingK is the KV utilization, as a fraction of PHYSICAL capacity, that a

// over.
//
// It is the product of the two thresholds because they compound: k1, the
// memory-bound capacity, is kvCacheThreshold of physical KV, and the analyzer
// scales out at scaleUpThreshold of k1. On the defaults (0.80, 0.85) that is
// 0.68 of physical; with scaleUpThreshold at 0.95 it is 0.76. Both sit inside
// the ITL window's band -- the policy's analyzerTuning.itlBand.minObservableK
// and analyzerTuning.itlBand.maxObservableK, 0.15 and 0.80 by default -- so
// the line is evaluated where it was fitted rather than beyond it. A product
// that is not positive (an unset threshold) prices at itl.DefaultKSat.

// model says nothing useful outside the range it was fitted on, and a clamped
// price is a worse answer than an extrapolated one only in theory.

// DeriveMuAtCap prices one replica of a variant at saturation under the

//
// kvPerRequest is the time-averaged footprint ILeff + D*OL/2
// (shape.Shape.KVreq): sequence ages are spread over each request's length,
// so with equal lengths the average resident sequence carries half its
// generation, and with a spread D = E[O^2]/OL^2 of them a long request,
// resident longer, weighs more (shape.WithOutputDispersion, issue #276).
//
// The cap is the one the derived k2 is priced at (the saturation analyzer's
// pricingBatchCap): the engine's max_num_seqs, lowered by
// --max-num-active-seqs when set (issue #335), and where the flags are unread
// the declared or learned cap in place of the parser's 256, which priced a
// sequence-bound engine above what it can run and so ordered too few replicas
// (issue #420). A batchCap of 0 caps nothing. The cap is not optional: short
// requests imply more resident sequences than the engine will admit, and the
// trace's second phase ran at exactly 256, the configured ceiling.
//
// max_num_seqs bounds ONE engine, and a data-parallel replica runs ranks of
// them (domain.ReplicaMetrics.Ranks): the replica admits ranks x max_num_seqs,
// the cap CappedSequences takes.
//
// C is the engine's whole KV capacity, not k1. k1 is already C times the
// analyzer's KV threshold, and itl.Sequences applies k itself, so passing k1
// would apply a threshold twice.
//
// avgOutput is the output length mu is divided by, passed in rather than taken
// from fleet: it must be the SHORT-window figure, while the shape keeps the [5m]
// one every other consumer shares. A count-weighted mean over five minutes is
// dominated by the previous shape's long stragglers for five minutes after they
// stop arriving -- measured decaying 3750 -> 250 across one 6000 -> 250 switch --
// and the divisor is where that error reaches mu undamped. KVreq, by contrast,
// is ILeff + OL/2 and barely moves: at a 20k prompt the same error shifts it
// about 1.5%.
