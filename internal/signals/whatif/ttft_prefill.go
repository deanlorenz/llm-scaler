// PrefillFromEstimate is the Prefill P1 supports: V_P, a and f from what
// internal/signals/prefill learned for one variant, with the replicas, the
// prompt and its spread left for the caller (the question's fleet and the
// traffic shape, which P1 does not learn).
//
// A V_P P1 refused is NoPrefillCapacity and an a it refused is
// NoFixedLatency, each with P1's reason as the detail. An f it refused (one
// pod, too few minutes) is left 0: one pod prices as 1, and more than one is
// refused when priced (NoImbalance) unless the caller assumes one.
//
// The prompt V_P was read at (VPPromptTokens) and, where a was taken from
// the curve (AModel quadratic), its per-token cost b + c*I are carried, so
// V_P is rescaled to the question's prompt (Prefill.shapedVP). The margin on
// V_P near the knee is DefaultVPMargin.
//
// P1's f is de-biased for Poisson arrivals, and the de-bias errs both ways
// (docs/proposals/slo-capacity-planner-ttft.md, "Where it is most wrong"):
// low on a real imbalance at few requests a pod (over-promises TTFT), high on
// equal pods with variable prompts (under-promises). It is carried as
// learned; P2 is what will show which way a real fleet leans.
