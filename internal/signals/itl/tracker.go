// reading -- is that one figure. An instant k against a minute's ITL, with
// the batch moving inside the minute, flattened the fitted slope and raised
// the remembered B (issue #393).
//
// A row is a reading when it is the variant's, Ready and not lent by the warm
// pool, with a finite positive ITL and a k inside adm's band (by default
// [DefaultMinObservableK, DefaultMaxObservableK]). A k above the band is a
// reading too when the replica is at its sequence cap (Admission.atSequenceCap);
// the zero Admission knows no cap and admits nothing above it. The band is
// judged per call, so a key's window may hold readings from a band the policy
// has since narrowed; they age out with the window. A full fit is taken when the
// window is Ready, and its B is remembered when positive. Otherwise, with at
// least DefaultMinSamples readings, A alone is fitted with B pinned to the
// remembered intercept, or DefaultBaselineSec before there is one: a fleet the
// router balances spans little of k, so this is the normal case, not a
// degenerate one.
//
// The full fit is judged and taken on steady readings only: those whose
// replica's k had not moved by more than DefaultMaxKDrift within
// DefaultSteadyFor, from a replica that has been serving at least that long.
// In a balanced fleet the only spread in k a window ever sees is a transient
// -- a replica joining, or the load stepping -- and across a transient k and
// ITL describe different moments, so the line through them is not ITL(k).
// Its intercept was remembered and pinned into every fit after it: on one
// run, two identical models in two namespaces kept B = 4.5 ms and 14.8 ms
// from whichever transient each window happened to catch, and priced the
// same replica at 5.3 and 7.7 requests/s (issue #270). The steady readings
// outlive the window by up to DefaultSteadyCarry, so a step's old level is
// still there when the new one settles, and the two give the spread.
//
// The pinned fit takes the steady readings too while there are at least
// DefaultMinSamples of them, and every reading only below that, so a fleet
// that has not settled yet still gets a line. A load step is a transient the
// pinned fit would otherwise take whole: on the issue #270 rerun A jumped from
// 0.077 to 0.207 on the cycle the load stepped, with every new reading
// unsteady and 10 steady ones held, and the derived mu fell from 6.4 to 2.65
// requests/s for two and a half minutes. It does not take the carry: see
// pinnedReadings. Taking every reading, it still leaves out those of a replica
// inside its settle -- a joiner's, or one the load came back to -- whose ITL
// covers its warm-up, and while fewer than DefaultMinSettledSamples remain it
// holds the key's last A. It holds the last A too once the window has fewer
// than DefaultMinSamples readings left -- a fleet below the band ages its
// readings out and offers none -- so a key that has fitted keeps a line through
// light load, or above the band (SlopeHeld says so, SlopeFittedAt when the A
// was fitted). Both holds end once the A is older than adm.SlopeHoldFor or was
// fitted under other engine arguments than adm.Args.
