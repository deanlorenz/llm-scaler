// The ITL line on the settle tracker (internal/signals/settle,
// analyzer-learner.md 4.3, PR 4a). A reading taken while its replica settles
// is kept out of the full fit and the pinned one (DefaultSteadyFor). Before
// the tracker each key kept its own trace of when each replica began to
// settle: it joined after the key's first Observe, or the load came back to
// it after idleRows rows with neither an ITL nor a k, or it was missing from
// a cycle. With Admission.Settle set, the start is read from the engine's
// tracker instead, and the key keeps only each replica's recent k, which the
// drift test reads (DefaultMaxKDrift).
//
// Three more changes ride on their own fields, each a replay switch of the
// analyzers that set them: WaitsAfterRestart, KeepsThroughMissingRow and
// FiniteOnly (Admission).

// Settle is the settle tracker Observe reads a replica's settle from, and the
// tracker's name for the model the rows are of (the engine's namespaced
// key). Read only: the engine writes the tracker, once per model per cycle,
// before any analyzer runs.

// start is when the replica of rm last began to settle, as the tracker read
// it: the later of the settle the tracker began (it joined, came back after
// its absence tolerance, restarted under its own name, was lent or rolled
// out), the last time load came back after at least idleRows idle rows
// (settle.Replica.ReturnedAfter: idle on positive evidence, settle.Row's
// Activity), and its first Ready row after one that was not
// (settlerow.ReadyAgain). A replica the tracker does not know -- a caller
// that skipped the observation -- has no start: zero, the same on every
// cycle, so the key's first sight of it is its settle.
//
// Two of those are the admission's rules (Admission.RestartUnderName and
// Admission.IdleOnEvidence). Without the first, a settle the tracker began
// because the Ready time changed under the same name is not read: a restart
// shows only as a row that was not Ready, as on the key's own trace. Without
// the second, load returning is the key's own count instead (idleReturn: a
// run of rows with neither an ITL nor a k).
