// rollout puts two under one key: the readings of each stay out of the other's
// fit. So the key remembers the revision its readings are of, and the rows
// decide (domain.NewestRevision): not the scale target's status, which a plain
// scale trips too.
//
// While the target rolls out, a line is offered the newest revision's rows
// alone. With no pod of a new revision serving it is offered none, and holds
// what it has: the old pods are what serves, and the old line prices them. The
// first rows of a new revision clear the window (clearWindowLocked), which
// keeps B and the held slope: a full fit never spans two engines, and the line
// holds its slope until 10 new readings arrive.

// revisionState is the revision a key's readings are of.
