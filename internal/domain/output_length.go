// The buckets say how many requests fell between two bounds, and not where:
// each bucket's mean can be anywhere between them, so E[O^2] is not known,
// only bounded. Its least value puts every bucket's requests at one length,
// the same length t in every bucket wherever its bounds allow, with t set so
// the lengths add up to the mean (a water level). The true E[O^2] is never
// below it: within a bucket the spread only adds, and no other placement that
// keeps the mean lowers the sum of squares. So a dispersion priced from it
// corrects the KV per request towards the truth and never past it, and a
// fleet whose requests are all one length reads no spread at all (D = 1).
//
// Not a reading: no +Inf bucket (the requests above the last bound are not
// counted), no requests, a mean that is not a positive finite number, or a
// mean the buckets cannot hold. A bucket rate that falls from one bound to the
// next (a counter reset inside the window) is read as no requests in that
