// An ALLOWLIST is a set of GPU bounds keyed by accelerator name: a quota's
// per-type caps, or a provider's per-type pools. It is closed: a name it does
// not list gets no GPUs under it. The functions below are the one reading of an
// allowlist, shared by the budget merge (the allocation package) and the
// configuration warnings (the config package), so the two cannot disagree on
// which key bounds which name.

// Bound is one allowlist value read as a GPU bound: the GPUs it leaves free, or
// no bound at all.
type Bound struct {
	// Free is the number of GPUs the bound leaves. Ignored when Unlimited.
	Free int
	// Unlimited is true for the -1 sentinel: no bound.
	Unlimited bool
}

// AllowlistBound is what one allowlist allows on the accelerator called name:
// the free GPUs, whether that is unlimited, and whether it lists name at all.
// bound reads one value of the allowlist.
//
//   - A key equal to name ignoring case is its bound; for a product name, a
//     listed family key bounds it too.
//   - A family name listed only through products is bounded by their SUM: an
//     allowlist of {NVIDIA-H100-80GB-HBM3: 4, NVIDIA-H100-SXM5-80GB: 4} allows
//     8 H100s, not 4, and is unlimited when one of them is.
//   - A product name not listed itself falls back to its family key, which
//     admits every product under it (FindKey's reading).
//
// Several case spellings of one key take the tightest.
