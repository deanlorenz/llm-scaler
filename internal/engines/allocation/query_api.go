// demandForRoleOrModel returns nr's demand for role — the single shared

// TotalDemand only on a genuine map miss. Returns 0 when nr has no Result.

// Reads RoleCapacities, not aggregation.DemandForRole(nr.Result, role)
// directly — the two are equal in real production data (buildRoleCapacities
// derives RoleCapacities[role].TotalDemand from Result.RoleDemand[role]
// exactly), but this mirrors requiredSpareForRoleOrModel's source of truth
// (also RoleCapacities, engine-built) so both halves of one role-vs-model

// rather than analyzer-owned demand). RoleCapacities is engine-built
// (buildRoleCapacities), so there is no accessor to share with

// small helper, but the SAME fallback shape, so a caller cannot special-case
// one without the other drifting.

// a disaggregated model can still carry a "both" RoleCapacities entry (e.g.
// an empty-Role variant mapped in alongside prefill/decode), and that entry
// must win over the model-level scalars when present. Only a genuine map
// miss falls back to the model-level RequiredCapacity/SpareCapacity.
