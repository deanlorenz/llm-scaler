// Review 187 minor: a partial replica's placed pods were charged on their
// node whenever the partial list had changed since the snapshot -- all of
// them, the ones the snapshot already counted too. A gang of four 2-GPU pods:
// the leader on a1 is in the snapshot, a worker placed beside it since is
// not. Only that worker is charged on a1, and the two pods still unplaced are
// held: 6 GPUs, not 8.
