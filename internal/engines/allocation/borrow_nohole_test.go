// Review M3 and the round-3 safety net: a replica ordered without a node hole

// borrower -- may never place: Kueue preempts by priority, not by node, and
// the borrower it takes may be a pod that was itself Pending. Namespace b is
// within its guaranteed figure (24 of 32 used), so the borrowed placement
// timeout never fired for it, and x's third 8-GPU replica waited Pending for
// good. The governor keeps it under the placement timeout like a borrowed
// one: released past the timeout (borrow-unplaced), the model backed off. A
