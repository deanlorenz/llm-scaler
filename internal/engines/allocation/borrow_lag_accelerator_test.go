// Review N-m3: a lagging draw (its pods exist, no read shows them yet) was
// netted against every gated pod of its namespace, whatever it ran on. In
// namespace a, an H100 decode's 8 borrowed GPUs lag; another variant's A100
// pod sits at Kueue's gate. The A100 pod absorbed the lag, and the H100
// chunk counted the 8 as free: a second borrower could take them. A gated pod
// covers only a draw of its own accelerator. Control: the gated pod is the
// H100 draw's own.
