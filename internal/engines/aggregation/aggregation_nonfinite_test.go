// These sums are multiplied by a replica count and then compared with `>` or `<`
// by every consumer -- the engine's RequiredCapacity and SpareCapacity clamps,
// and the throughput floor's two caps. A NaN makes every such comparison false,
// so one variant with an unusable PerReplicaCapacity did not merely corrupt its
// own term: it disabled the guard the consumer applied to the whole sum, and the
// clamp meant to bound the result silently did not fire.
//
// So the property under test is not "the arithmetic is right" but "no single
// variant can make a total non-finite".
