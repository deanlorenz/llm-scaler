// admitted to the ledger, not only growth. A borrower Kueue preempted has
// its replacement pod at the admission gate, holding no node: its target
// equals its current replicas, yet the ledger held a phantom hole for it on
// the node the preemption freed, for five minutes, from the very lender the
// preemption was for. Only growth starts a hold; growth still in flight
// keeps its entry.
