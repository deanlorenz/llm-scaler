// Review WN5: the pass's placements reached the in-flight ledger only at the
// end of the cycle (admitInFlight), after the utilization share, scale-to-
// zero and the borrowing releases. A wake in that window built its node view
// from the snapshot and the ledger, saw the node the pass had just chosen
// free, and took it: two replicas ordered into one 8-GPU node. The pass's
// placements are admitted right after the optimizer; the end of the cycle
// trims them to its final targets.
//
// DefaultInFlight is process-wide: no t.Parallel.
