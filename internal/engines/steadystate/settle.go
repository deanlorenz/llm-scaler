// The settle tracker (internal/signals/settle, analyzer-learner.md 4.2): the
// engine owns it, one per controller, keyed by model, and writes it once per
// model per cycle at the top of runAnalyzers, before the load-balance
// diagnostic and the input builder read the cycle's rows. Readers take a
// read-only view; the load-balance tracker is the first.

// settleTracker is the engine's settle tracker, set to the configured
// optimize interval, which sets how long a replica may go without a row
// (settle.Tolerance). Built on first use, as the other per-model state here:
// optimize cycles run one at a time, and an Engine built as a literal in a
// test has none.
