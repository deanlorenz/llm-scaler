// RequiredCapacity is the figure that sizes a scale-up, so a non-finite one is
// worse than a wrong one: it reaches the optimizer as the amount to add.
//
// The clamp used to be `if rc < 0 { rc = 0 }`, and a NaN fails every comparison,
// so a NaN walked straight through it. The supply side of `rc` is now finite by
// construction (aggregation refuses to carry a non-finite capacity into a sum),
// but DEMAND is deliberately not sanitized -- silently dropping a role's demand
// would be worse than declining to act on it -- so the clamp is the place a
// non-finite figure has to fail closed.
