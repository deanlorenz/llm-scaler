// olsSweepMinFullFits is the fewest full ITL fits ols-sweep's replay must
// take. At the commit the golden was added, the replay took 101 full and 94
// pinned fits, the same counts as the controller's own itl-fit lines of the
// run (tier=ols and tier=pinned-B). The floor is not that count: a learner
// change may move fits and rewrite lines.csv with make learner-goldens, which
// does not touch this number. What it must not do is lose the full fits this
// recording exists for. A PR that drops the replay below the floor says why
// in its description and lowers it here, keeping the 101/94 above as the
// recording-time reference.

// The ols-sweep golden's own replay takes full ITL fits, not only pinned
// ones. The summed path check is met by the in-process mu-paths run alone,
// and make learner-goldens rewrites lines.csv to whatever the replay gives,
// so without this a cluster recording that lost its full fits would pass.
