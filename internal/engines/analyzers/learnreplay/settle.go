// The settle tracker in a replay (analyzer-learner.md, 4.2). The engine
// observes each model's rows at the top of its cycle and records the model
// and the instant (settle.KindObserve); the rows are the ones the model's
// next Analyze event records. The replay applies the observation as the
// engine did: at the recorded instant, with that Analyze's rows.
//
// A recording made before the engine recorded its observations has none.
// There the replay observes at each saturation Analyze's own clock: the
// cycle clock, which is the instant the engine observes at, at the default
// optimize interval. A cycle whose collection failed (settle.KindHold) is in
// no such recording, so the fallback cannot hold through one.
//
// The saturation analyzer's k2 reads the replay's tracker (its joined test),
// as it read the engine's. A recording is an engine's: one made by driving
// the analyzer alone gives it a tracker of the caller's, observed as the
// engine does, or its replay reads otherwise from the first cycle (the
// analyzer alone takes its first cycle's replicas as already watched,
// saturation.observeOwnSettle).
//
// A known gap: an observation applies only with the next saturation Analyze
// of its model. A cycle the engine observed and then did not analyze (an
// error between the observation and the Analyze) leaves its observation
// pending, and the next one replaces it, so the replay's tracker misses
// rows the engine's saw, and k2 reads what the replay's holds. None of the
// committed recordings has such a cycle.
//
// The engine also forgets, at the top of each cycle, the settle record of
// every model it does not reconcile that cycle (retainSettle, from
// optimizeV2's prune; retainSettle(nil) on a cycle with no active variant),
// and records no event for it. The replay derives it: every model the
// engine reconciles gets one observation or one hold a cycle, and every
// cycle starts with the slo analyzer's BeginCycle. So a model whose last
// observation or hold was before the previous cycle sat out a cycle, and
// its record is forgotten before its next observation or hold applies
// (retain). Only that model's own Analyze reads its record, after its
// observation, so forgetting it then is what forgetting it at the cycle
// that dropped it was. A cycle that follows failed ones begins twice
// (beginSLOCycle's catch-up); two BeginCycles less than an interval apart
// are one cycle (beginCycle). A recording with
// no observation, or no BeginCycle, forgets nothing: its engine either had
// no retain or no slo analyzer to count cycles by.
//
// The replay counts the tracker's verdicts per reason (2.5), so a golden set
// that never reaches one says so.

// and the reason.

// per fixture by TestGoldens_PDRestartReplayRestartsForReal. The committed
// recordings reach a rejoin only through their synthetic generators (clocks
