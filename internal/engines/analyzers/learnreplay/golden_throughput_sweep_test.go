// The throughput-sweep goldens are one cluster run of the recipe in
// docs/developer-guide/testing.md (learner goldens) with the throughput
// analyzer listed beside saturation: a P/D decode fleet under the closed-loop
// sweep, the leader controller Pod deleted 20 min in, so the run gives two
// recordings, throughput-sweep and throughput-sweep-restart
// (analyzer-learner.md, PR 4b, "Recordings"). They are the only goldens whose
// throughput line sees a real decode engine: the wait after a controller
// start, readings above the band, full fits, and a replica at its sequence
// cap. No joiner is recorded: the one decode pod never scales. The run's
// policy band is 0.12-0.70, not the default.

// throughputSweepFloor is which of the throughput line's paths a recording's
// own replay must reach. Each must be above zero (2.5's per-path counters):
// full and pinned fits and settling readings in both, and readings admitted
// at the sequence cap in the restart recording, whose load reaches the cap.
// A floor is a count, not a rate. At the commit that added them the replay
// counted 18 full, 9 pinned and 5 settling in throughput-sweep, and 10 full,
// 14 pinned, 8 settling and 20 at the cap in throughput-sweep-restart; a PR
// that lowers a floor says why.
//
// Every settling reading in both is the wait after a controller start: a
// replica already serving when the controller started
// (throughput.SwitchITLWaitsAfterRestart). With that switch off the path counts
// 0 in both, though no output file moves, so a settling floor is all that
// holds it here.
//
// Every pinned fit in the restart recording comes from the cap's readings:
// with throughput.SwitchITLAdmitsAtSequenceCap off the path counts 0 pinned
// there, and 7 above-band fits take their place.
//
// Since the tier dwell (issue #495) throughput-sweep's 9 pinned fits are gone:
// the spread collapses inside the dwell, and the line holds its slope, 8 times.
// Its floor is the held path in their place; the restart recording still
// floors the pinned one. The restart recording's light load holds nothing: it
// ends with 35 minutes of it, and the line stayed silent through them with cause
// shape-change, since a shape change drops the held slope with the window.
