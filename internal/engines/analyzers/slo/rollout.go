// SwitchITLRolloutGuard is the replay switch for the line's rollout guard
// (issue #481, itl.Tracker.RolloutRows). On, while the variant's scale target
// rolls out (capacity.Record.InRollout) or its replicas report more than one
// revision (domain.RevisionsMixed), the line is offered the newest revision's
// rows alone: an old pod's reading would be judged against the new engine's
// sequence cap, and a fit would span two engines. The first rows of a new
// revision clear the window. With no new pod serving it is offered none, and
// holds what it has, under the arguments it was learned under
// (pricingDetail.rolloutHeld): the old pods still serve, so a change of
// arguments waits for a new pod too (linesUnderArgs). Off, as before, every row
// is offered.
