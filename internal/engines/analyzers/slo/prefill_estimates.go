// P1's figures, read from the saturation analyzer (docs/proposals/slo-tiers.md,
// "Where P1's figures come from").
//
// P1's observer lives in the saturation analyzer, which feeds it decode's
// back-pressure and the back-pressure bound, two inputs this analyzer does
// not have. So this analyzer runs no observer of its own: it reads each
// prefill variant's latest estimate from the saturation analyzer's stash,
// through PrefillEstimates, and never rebuilds the observer's key.
//
// Lock order: the read takes the saturation analyzer's mu (and that
// analyzer takes the observer's lock only with its own released); this
// analyzer's own mu is taken only after the read, never around it. The read
// holds no lock of this analyzer's, so a caller on an Analyze path that
// already holds a.mu cannot deadlock itself (sync.Mutex is not reentrant),
// and the saturation analyzer never calls back here, so no cycle forms.

// PrefillEstimates reads a prefill variant's latest P1 estimate, when it was
// written on the engine's cycle clock, and whether there is one.
// *saturation.SaturationAnalyzer implements it.
//
// A caller reads it once per prefill variant per cycle: each call takes the
// saturation analyzer's lock and copies the estimate's maps.

// a cycle in which the observation did not run is never read. The engine
// runs saturation before this analyzer, so the estimate is the one made from
// this cycle's rows.
//
// The stamp check is exact only while the cycle clock is pinned across both
// analyzers for the cycle (cycleclock in the engine, the replay's clock in
// learnreplay): two cycles at the same instant would pass the earlier
// cycle's estimate as this one's.
