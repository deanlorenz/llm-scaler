// The SLO line on the settle tracker (analyzer-learner.md, section 7, PR
// 4a): the same six changes as the saturation analyzer's ITL line, each
// behind a switch of this package, since this analyzer fits its own line
// with its own itl.Tracker. The engine writes the tracker once per model per
// cycle, before any analyzer runs, and hands this analyzer a read-only view
// (WithSettleView). An analyzer given none (a test that drives Analyze
// alone) observes a tracker of its own at the top of each Analyze, as one
// that has watched the fleet: nothing restarted.

// SwitchITLReadsSettle is the replay switch for the move: on, a replica's
// settle starts where the settle tracker says (itl.Settle); off, as before,
// the line's own trace of each replica.

// SwitchITLLongGapFirstSeen is the replay switch for a long gap on the
// analyzer's own tracker (issue #459): on, a model last analyzed more than
// the state timeout ago is first-seen, whether or not EvictStale ran
// meanwhile, and wherever in the cycle it ran (observeOwnSettle); off, as
// before, only a model EvictStale evicted is, and one it did not reads the
// gap as an absence (settle.Rejoined). Read only with SwitchITLReadsSettle
// on, and only by an analyzer with no engine view.

// cycle waits its settle too, so the line does not refit for

// settled. An analyzer with its own tracker never waits.

// A model the own tracker does not hold -- never seen, or evicted by

// ago, not yet evicted, are both first-seen: what the tracker held of the
// model is forgotten, its rows are observed backdated, and every line key of
// the model forgets its replicas' settle traces (itl.Tracker.ForgetTraces,
// absent variants included), so nothing settles. The eviction runs only from
// EvictStale, so before this a gap past the timeout read as an absence
// (settle.Rejoined), and every replica settled, unless EvictStale had run
// first; and run between two models' Analyze calls, it settled the model
// analyzed before it and not the one after. Reading a stale model as an
// evicted one makes the result depend only on the model's own last sight,
// as the throughput analyzer's (learner PR 4b-2). SwitchITLLongGapFirstSeen,
