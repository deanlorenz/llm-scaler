// The closed-loop probe (analyzer-learner.md, 2.5; PR 4b, "Tests") for the
// throughput analyzer's ITL line, on the fleet simulator the saturation
// analyzer's probe runs on (learnertest.Fleet). Each case pastes its result
// with the line on the tracker and on the parent's line (both switches off).
//
// The physics, per Ready replica of a decode variant: the true line is
// ITL(k) = probeA k + probeB, and a replica at KV fill k serves
// k C / KVreq / ITL(k) tokens a second. Offered r requests a second of
// probeOL output tokens each, it settles at the k that serves them, up to
// probeKMax; beyond that it serves its limit and queues. A replica's first
// probeWarmCycles cycles after it turns Ready read the warm-up ITL a real
// engine reports (0.45 s, as on the two-namespace run), at its k.
//
// The analyzer's order is its demand (the arrival rate times the mean
// output length) over its per-replica supply, rounded up; a cycle with no
// throughput capacity for the variant holds the fleet (learnertest.Hold), as
// a silent analyzer leaves the decision to the others. Need is that order
// priced on the true line: what a truthful line orders.
