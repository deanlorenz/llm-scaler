// The ITL line on the shared tracker (docs/proposals/analyzer-learner.md,
// PR 4b-1). The line was fitted from a window of every healthy reading, with
// a pinned fit over the cycle's own rows; it now fits as the saturation and
// slo analyzers' lines do, with a tracker of its own (itl.Tracker), keyed by
// variant as the window was. Two named changes, each behind a replay switch.

// SwitchITLSteadyGate is the replay switch for the move onto itl.Tracker,
// and #273's fixes with it. On: the full fit is taken from steady readings
// only; a reading taken while its replica settles (it joined, or load came
// back after idle) is stamped and kept out of the pinned fit; the pinned fit
// is the k-weighted mean of (ITL - B) / k over the window's readings in the
// band, with at least itl.DefaultMinSamples readings and
// steadyGate.minSettledSamples settled; B is remembered only when positive;
// an ITL of +Inf is no reading; and when there are too few readings the
// line holds its last A (Reason T2-held), for at most the slope hold and
// under the same engine arguments. A key with neither a line in the band
// nor a slope it may hold -- one that never fitted, under load that holds
// every replica above the band -- fits from its steady, settled readings
// above the band instead (Reason T2-above-band,
// itl.Admission.AboveBandFallback), until the band fits. A shape change
// empties the window and drops the held slope: the old shape's A is not
// held into the new shape. Since PR 4b-2 the settle is read from the
// engine's settle tracker, under switches of its own (settle.go). Off, as
