// The ITL line's settle on the engine's settle tracker (analyzer-learner.md,
// PR 4b-2). Since 4b-1 the line stamps a reading taken while its replica
// settles and keeps it out of the pinned fit, judging the settle from the
// key's own trace of each replica. From 4b-2 the settle start is read from
// the engine's tracker, which the engine observes at the top of every cycle,
// before any analyzer runs, and hands this analyzer read-only
// (WithSettleView). Six replay switches, one per named change, as the
// saturation and slo analyzers' lines took them in learner PR 4a: the move
// itself, and five behaviour changes that ride on it. Each is meaningful
// only with SwitchITLSteadyGate on: the parent's window has no settle.
//
// An analyzer given no view (a test that drives Analyze alone, a replay of a
// recording from before 4b-0) observes a tracker of its own at the top of
// each Analyze, as the slo analyzer does, standing for a controller that has
// watched the fleet: nothing waits after a restart.

// SwitchITLReadsSettle is the replay switch for the move. On, a replica's
// settle starts where the settle tracker says: it joined, came back past
// the absence tolerance (settle.Rejoined), was lent, or rolled out to a new
// revision under its name (settle.RolledOut); load came back after
// steadyGate.idleRows idle rows; or it was Ready again after a row that was
// not. Off, as in 4b-1, the line's own trace of each replica: a joiner, a
// return after idleRows rows with neither an ITL nor a k, and any replica
// missing from a cycle or not Ready on one.
//
// Differences that are the move's own: a gap between two of the model's
// cycles longer than the absence tolerance (a controller paused, a clock
// jump) is an absence to the tracker, and every replica settles again; the
// line's own trace counted an absence only by cycles that went without a
// replica. A new revision under the same Pod name settles; the own trace
// saw it only through a row that was not Ready. A warm-pool lend is a new
// key on the tracker, but the line reads no lent row on either path
// (ownReplicasOnly, and itl.Tracker refuses FromWarmPool), so a lend moves
// nothing here.
const SwitchITLReadsSettle = "throughput-itl-reads-the-settle-tracker"

// SwitchITLWaitsAfterRestart is the replay switch for the line's wait after
// a controller restart (analyzer-learner.md 4.4). The engine's tracker is
// new with the controller, so it first sees every replica on the first
// cycle (settle.Joined). On, a replica already serving on the line's first
// cycle waits its settle too, from the tracker's first sight of it: no line
// from the band for steadyGate.steadyFor after a restart, then until the
// window holds itl.DefaultMinSamples readings, and the analyzer is silent
// meanwhile unless the above-band fallback prices it. The fallback's window
// does not wait (it is one-sided: a warm-up reading can only raise its
// price), only a replica that became Ready within steadyFor is kept out of
// it. Off, as in 4b-1, such a replica is taken as settled. The wait is read
// only on the tracker (SwitchITLReadsSettle on) with an engine view: an
// analyzer with no view stands for a controller that has watched the
// fleet, and the line's own trace does not wait.

// SwitchITLKeepsSettleThroughMissingRow is the replay switch for the

// cycle keeps its settle for up to the tracker's absence tolerance
// (settle.Tolerance: 2.5 optimize intervals, at least 1 min): one missed
// scrape is not a replica that left. Off, as in 4b-1, a replica missing
// from one cycle starts its settle over.

// not Ready shows the restart.

// SwitchITLIdleOnEvidence is the replay switch for what an idle row is, on

// known KV of 0, and a known empty ITL window or a known generation rate of
// 0; on a prefill pod a known request rate of 0); a scrape that read
// nothing neither counts nor breaks an idle run. Off, as on the line's own

// SwitchITLReadsFinitePodMean is the replay switch for what a reading's ITL

// state its presence bits give (domain.ReplicaMetrics.ITLState): a Pod with
// an Absent rank, whose AvgITL is its Finite ranks' mean, is refused. Off,

// SwitchITLOwnSettleBackdates is the replay switch for the backdate on the

// one, at the cycle, of replicas Joined ownSettleBackdate earlier
// (settlerow.ObserveOwnSince). Off, as before, the rows are observed at the
// backdate and again at the cycle (settlerow.ObserveOwn), and below a 48 s
// interval the gap between the two is past the tracker's absence
// tolerance: every replica reads settle.Rejoined at the cycle. Read only by

// of the model forgets its replicas' settle traces (itl.Tracker.ForgetTraces,
// absent variants included), so the keys read every replica as on their
// first cycle and nothing settles. The eviction runs inside observe, so
// after a long gap the model analyzed first that cycle is still held and
// stale, and every model after it was evicted meanwhile; reading both the
// same way is what makes the settle reading independent of the order. Only
// the settle reading: what the eviction sweeps besides (the line's windows,
