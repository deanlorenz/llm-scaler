// Forgetting one variant's ITL line, on an operator's request, as the slo
// analyzer forgets its own (slo/forget.go). The forget-learned-state
// annotation is read by the engine, which acts on a token once, through the
// saturation analyzer's mark (saturation.ForgottenToken), and then forgets
// the variant in every analyzer that keeps a line. This analyzer keeps no
// token of its own: it forgets when the engine asks.
//
// Before, the line went on pricing from the readings taken before a forget,
// and held the slope fitted from them for up to the slope hold.
//
// What a forget takes, per field of ThroughputAnalyzer: what the line's
// tracker has learned of the key (lines: the window, the steady window, the
// readings above the band and their steady ones, the intercept and the held
// slope, and with the windows every settling stamp and every reading taken
// at the sequence cap), and what learner-write last logged of it (itlLogged).
// Of a variant's state (variantStates, forgetLine), the parent's window and
// B, and the figures last priced from the line. The sequence cap is not
// learned: the admission reads it from the store each cycle, and with B gone
// a line at the cap prices one-sided again.
//
// What it keeps: the replicas' traces in lines
// (itl.Tracker.ForgetKeysKeepingTraces), which say what each replica is doing
// now and fit nothing. The saturation and slo forgets drop theirs. Here a
// trace dropped would blind the steady gate for a cycle: a step in load on
// the first cycle after a forget would read as steady
// (TestForget_TheSteadyGateSeesTheFirstCycleAfter). And a replica's settle is
// read through its trace on every path, so one inside its settle stays
// inside it: with the engine's view, on the analyzer's own tracker, and on
// the key's own trace; with no trace, only the engine's view with its wait
// would keep it (TestForget_AReplicaSettlingAtAForgetStillSettlesOnEveryPath).
// Also kept: ownSettle and ownSettled, when each replica was last seen, which
// the engine's tracker keeps alike; the shape, the traffic now, which no line
// is learned from; the role, whether the variant is rolling out, and the log
// lines' memories of what they last said; paths, the replay's counters over every fit. The rest is
// configuration or plumbing. Two tests hold every field to one of those lists
// (TestForget_EveryFieldIsClassified,
// TestForget_EveryVariantStateFieldIsClassified).
//
// Nothing here brings a forgotten line back. This analyzer restores nothing:
// the learned-state snapshot holds the saturation analyzer's line, under
// keys of another shape, and no method here is named as a restore
// (TestForget_NothingHereRestoresALine). It borrows no line: a key is one
// variant's, so a sibling's readings are filed under the sibling. A lent
// replica's rows are refused by itl.Tracker (FromWarmPool), and ownReplicasOnly
// drops them before Analyze reaches it, as defence in depth
// (TestForget_NoSiblingOrLentReplicaRefillsTheLine).

// SwitchITLForgetReachesTheLine is the replay switch for the forget: on, the
// annotation forgets the variant's ITL line here too -- what its tracker
// learned of the key, the parent's window and B, and the figures priced from
// the line; off, as before, it forgets nothing here.
