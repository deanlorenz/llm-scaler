// noteLineMismatch logs, and only logs, when this replica's observed
// generation-token rate disagrees with what the fitted line predicts at the
// replica's own utilization.
//
// It is a DIAGNOSTIC, not a gate, and that is a decision taken against
// measurement rather than taste.
//
// The proposal asks for a derived mu to be verified against the observed rate
// before it may order. Built as a gate, that verification withheld ordering
// 28 times in run T (2026-09-28) and every one of them fell inside the first
// two minutes of the run -- the phase-1 ramp -- with the predicted rate above
// the observed one nearly every time, and on four cycles every replica of the
// role rejected at once. The fleet still reached 9 so the run stands, but its
// phase-1 TTFT p95 was 64 s against main's 42 s.
//
// The cause is not a threshold that needs tuning. The signals this check
// reads are not collected over the same window -- KvUsageInstant has none,
// while GenerationTokenRate and AvgITL are both rate[1m] -- so on a ramp k reaches
// its new level in seconds while the 1m rate still reports a fraction of the
// steady state. The disagreement is therefore largest exactly when a scale-up
// is needed, and it moves every replica together, so neither N-consecutive
// cycles nor a majority-of-replicas rule suppresses it.
//
// What it is still worth: it is the line that let run T be diagnosed, and a
// persistent mismatch away from a ramp is real evidence that the shape, and so
// KVreq, does not describe the fleet. The collector now has a k averaged over
// the same window as the rate (KvUsageMean, which the ITL line is fitted
// from: issue #393), so this can become a gate again. Until it does, the check
// still pairs the instant k with the rate[1m] figures, and only logs.
//
// Warm-pool replicas and roles priced from no line (itlLineRole: prefill,
// and an aggregated variant with SwitchITLFitsAggregated off) are skipped
// rather than logged: a
// bridge runs on the pool's own engine settings (noteITL excludes it from the
// fit for that reason and floor.Estimate prices it not at all), and a prefill
// replica generates about one token per request, so neither disagreement means
// anything about this variant's line.
// borrowedFrom is the variant this line was measured on when it is not this
// variant's own, and empty otherwise. Logged because this is the ONLY line
// that fires when a line does not match reality, and the two cases have
// different remedies: a mismatch on a borrowed line says those two
// configurations are not really alike and names who to look at, while a
// mismatch on an own line says this variant's own fit has drifted.

// noteITL adds this cycle's (k, ITL) readings for one variant to its rolling
// window and returns the reading: the model fitted over what the window holds,
// and whether it is a slope held for want of readings (SlopeHeld) rather than
// a fit made now.
//
// Ready replicas of the variant itself only, and only where both halves of the
// pair are present: a pod still failing its readiness probe, or one lent by the
// warm pool, is not a reading of what one of this variant's replicas does.
//
// Why the warm-pool exclusion, stated correctly -- an earlier version of this
// comment said a lent pod runs "the pool's own engine settings", and that is
// false by construction. warmpool.EngineOptionsFrom derives the warm copy's
// command line from the ordinary replicas' own PodSpec precisely so the two
// MATCH (a different --gpu-memory-utilization is a different torch.compile
// cache key), and warmableFlags covers every flag the fingerprint hashes. By
// default a lent pod therefore hashes to the SAME engine configuration, so the
// fingerprint cannot be what tells it apart.
//
// What tells it apart is what it is running: a pool Pod hosts one awake engine
// plus its sleepers, each keeping ~1.4 GiB of GPU residue
// (internal/warmpool/demand.go measured
// 4.4 GiB free at 0.95 on an 80 GiB card). Its ITL(k) is the latency of an
// engine sharing a card, which is not the latency of one of this variant's own
// replicas -- and k itself is read against a KV budget the sleepers have
// already eaten into. A pool that does set an explicit GPUMemoryUtilization
// does also change the digest, but the exclusion cannot rest on that: zero
// inherits the workload's value, and zero is the default.
//
// Above itl.DefaultMaxObservableK the
// engine preempts rather than slowing down and the line stops describing it, so
// those readings are left out too.
//
// The window is NOT cleared on a shape change, which is the difference from the
// throughput analyzer's use of it. ITL(k) is a property of the hardware and the
// engine, not of the shape -- that is the whole reason mu can be derived across
// a shape change -- so a fit made under one shape is still the right fit under
// the next, and clearing it would reintroduce exactly the wait this replaces.
