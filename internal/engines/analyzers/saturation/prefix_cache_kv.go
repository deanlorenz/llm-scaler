// The KV a resident request holds, when some of its prompt was a prefix-cache
// hit (issue #277).
//
// shape.New discounts the prompt by the hit rate, ILeff = IL*(1 - hit), as if
// every hit saved KV. A hit saves compute, but it saves KV only when the block
// it hits is also held by another running request: a hit on a block a
// finished request left behind makes that block the new request's own, so it
// is resident as if it had been computed. With multi-turn reuse most hits are
// of that kind, and pricing the resident request at ILeff + D*OL/2 then
// over-counts the sequences a cache holds, up to about 4x. The derived mu
// (whatif.DeriveMuAtCap) sizes its sequence count by that figure, so an over-counted
// count over-states mu and under-orders replicas.
//
// The engine says how many requests it holds (vllm:num_requests_running,
// sglang:num_running_reqs; domain.ReplicaMetrics.RunningRequests), and its
// cache says how many tokens they hold (vLLM counts a block once however many
// running requests share it, and a cached block no running request holds as
// free), so the KV per resident request can be measured: the tokens in use
// over the running requests, over the fleet's Ready generating replicas
// (fleetResidentKVPerRequest). Where there is a reading it replaces the
// assumed discount; where there is none the request is priced at
// ILeff + D*OL/2, as before.
//
// The reading is bounded below by the shape's own KVreq, ILeff + D*OL/2, and
// above by the same shape with no hit, IL + D*OL/2. So it moves the price
// only towards the measured residency, and never below the discount: the
// derived mu is never above the one before, and without evidence it is the
// one before. Outside the bounds:
//
//   - below: requests part way through their prefill (resident, their prompt
//     not yet all written), or a spread of output lengths D under-states. Not
//     taken as more sharing than the hit rate allows.
//   - above: a prompt length that lags the workload, which the shape tracker
//     answers; or, on the decode side of a prefill/decode split, KV that
//     vLLM allocates for a request as it starts pulling the prompt's KV from
//     prefill, while the request waits (WAITING_FOR_REMOTE_KVS) and is not
//     counted as running. Under transfer load that numerator holds KV no
//     running request does, and the reading moves towards no discount. No
//     gauge counts those blocks, so it is not subtracted; it errs towards
//     more replicas.
//
// A reading is taken only where the requests read are enough of what the
// pricing point holds for the reading to describe it. A prefix several
// running requests share is held once and spread over the requests running
// now, so few requests read each one's share of it high: 500 shared and 500
// unique prompt tokens with 100 out, at hit 0.5, read 800 a request at 2
// running and 554 at the 123 the pricing point holds, where the shape says
// 550. Two gates, both the ITL band's lower edge
// (analyzerTuning.itlBand.minObservableK, minK below):
//
//   - by fill: only replicas whose KV fill is at least minK are read. The band
//     is where the line mu is priced from is fitted.
//   - by count: the requests read must be at least minK x C / KVreq, C the
//     summed capacity of the replicas read and KVreq the shape's own, with
//     the hit rate's discount (withResidentKV). That is the band's edge in
//     requests: the count a cache filled to minK holds if the discount is
//     right. The fill gate alone does not bound it where prompts are long
//     against the cache: a 500,000-token cache with 100,000-token prompts,
//     90% of them shared, holds 2 requests at a fill of 0.22 and reads 55,500
//     a request where the shape says 10,500 -- a KV-bound mu 5x low.
//
// The count gate costs the issue's own case some of its reach. Where the hits
// are on blocks no running request shares, a request holds IL + D*OL/2 and a
// cache at fill k holds k x C / (IL + D*OL/2) of them, so the count gate
// passes only from a fill of minK x (IL + D*OL/2) / (ILeff + D*OL/2): 0.30 at
// a discount that halves the request, 0.60 at one that quarters it, and
// above the pricing point (0.68 of the cache on the defaults) at one that
// cuts it more than about 4.5x. There the price stays the
// discount, as before; a line in the running count that separates the shared
// KV from each request's own would read both (a follow-up).
//
// The noise a reading keeps is one-sided: a reading below the shape's KVreq
// is clamped to it and changes nothing, while one above moves the price. The
// spread of prompt lengths is not modelled (minResidentSequences models the
// age of the generated part only), so on long prompts read over few requests
// the reading errs towards more replicas, at most to the price with no
// discount.
//
// The reading is taken while a shape change is outstanding too. The requests
// resident then belong to both shapes, but each shape that is priced bounds
// the reading by its own ILeff and IL (withResidentKV), and the short-window
// shape is the new one, so a mixed population moves the price no further
// than between the new shape's discount and none.
//
// SGLang publishes both readings as the busiest rank's (max by pod), against
// the pod's whole KV capacity, so on a pod running data-parallel attention
// ranks the reading would over-read by about the rank count and land on the
// upper bound. That is not verified on a cluster; it errs towards more
// replicas, at most to the price with no discount.
//
// It moves the derived mu and the GPS check that predicts a token rate from
// the same KV per request (noteLineMismatch). It does not move the prompt
// length prefill's throughput key is discounted by (throughputKeyInput): a hit
// does save prefill compute. Nor the derived k2 or the zero-replica estimate,
// which price the full prompt already (estimateCapacityAtCapSpread).

// SwitchKVPerRequestHitsResident is the replay switch for prefix-cache hits
// that stay resident (issue #277). On, the derived mu and the GPS check price
// a resident request at the KV the fleet's running requests are measured to
// hold, between ILeff + D*OL/2 and IL + D*OL/2, and at ILeff + D*OL/2 with no
// reading. Off, at ILeff + D*OL/2 throughout.
