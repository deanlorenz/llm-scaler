// withExpectedOutputTokens returns replicaMetrics with expected filled in as
// the output length of every OUTPUT-GENERATING replica that reports none.
//
// It exists so the scheduler queue can be priced on the first cycle of load.
// estimateSchedulerQueueDemand charges the queue Q x avgOutput, and avgOutput
// is an average over replicas that have COMPLETED something; on a cold fleet
// none has, so the queue is worth nothing to the role that will generate it.
// Measured on run QL: decode's share read {"decode":0} for the first two
// cycles with 141 requests already queued.
//
// A COPY, never a mutation of the caller's slice. The input is the analyzer's
// own AnalyzerInput, read by several other steps in the same cycle, and a
// replica whose reported output length was quietly rewritten would change what
// every one of them measured -- including the throughput keys and the shape
// tracker, which must follow what the fleet actually served.
//
// Only replicas that generate output, and only those reporting zero: a prefill
// replica completes about one token per request, so filling it in would move a
// figure that is already correct, and a replica with a real reading is not
// improved by a default.
//
// Returns the input unchanged when expected is not positive or nothing needs
// filling, so the common case allocates nothing.

// computeModelWorkloadAverages computes the model-level average input tokens,

// The output length is averaged over the replicas that GENERATE output, which
// on a P/D fleet excludes prefill. A prefill replica completes every request
// after one token (it hands off to decode), so its own
// vllm:request_generation_tokens averages ~1 -- not a measurement of the
// workload's output length but a property of the role. Folding it into an
// unweighted mean halves the model's output length at one prefill per decode
// replica and quarters it at three, and everything priced per queued request
// downstream (the scheduler queue's output-token charge, the zero-replica k2
// derivation) shrinks with it. Measured on a P/D run: 213 requests queued at
// the scheduler were charged 500 output tokens each against a 1000-token
// workload, because the one prefill replica's ~1 averaged against the one
// decode replica's 1000.

// cache that a queued prompt can hit lives on the prefill side.
