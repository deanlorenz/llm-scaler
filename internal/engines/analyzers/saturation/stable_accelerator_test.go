// StableAcceleratorFor exists so the engine-configuration metric can report the
// accelerator the learned-state key is actually built with. Everything here is
// about one property: it answers the same question stableAccelerator answers,
// and WRITES NOTHING while doing it.
//
// That property is the whole reason the accessor exists rather than a second
// caller of stableAccelerator. The memo's lastUsed is the eviction clock
// EvictStaleHistory reads, so a reader that touched it would keep the memo alive
// for as long as the metric publishes -- which is every cycle, for every
// variant, forever. The metric would quietly pin the map it describes.
