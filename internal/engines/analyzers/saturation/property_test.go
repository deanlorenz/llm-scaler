// Property tests for the analyzers' learners (docs/proposals/analyzer-learner.md,
// 2.6 and 2.7). Each case is a synthetic input run against one learner on
// many seeds. A check returns a *propViolation when the learner breaks the
// property, and any other error when the case itself could not run; the
// latter never counts as a known failure.
//
// A case that fails on today's code by design is a row of the known-failures
// ledger (testdata/properties/known-failures.yaml), with the violation kind
// it is expected to fail with. Each subtest judges its own case against the
// ledger, so a filtered -run judges only what it ran:
//   - a case not in the ledger fails its subtest on any violation;
//   - a ledgered case must fail with its expected kind, and fails its subtest
//     if it fails with another kind, or (on a full seed run) not at all.
//
// The judgement, the ledger and the generators the analyzers share are
// learnertest's (the throughput analyzer's cases run on them too); the names
// below are theirs. The cases are in property_<learner>_test.go, the
// saturation analyzer's generators in property_gen_test.go, the mutants and
// the 2.7 accounting in property_mutants_test.go, and the coverage table in
// property_coverage_test.go.
