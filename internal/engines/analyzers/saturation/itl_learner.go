// The ITL line as a learner on the shared rules (docs/proposals/
// analyzer-learner.md, 6.1 to 6.3, PR 4a): each cycle it files a
// learn.Report per decode variant it fitted, logs one learner-write line per
// key whose line moved, and Forget reaches it through learn's list of
// learners. The analyzer logs; the Report carries counts, never a log line.

// ITLWriteBand is how far a key's A or B must move from the value
// learner-write last logged, as a fraction of that value, before it logs the
// line again. A change of tier (a full fit, B pinned, a held slope) logs
// whatever the values did. A pinned fit refits A on every cycle from a
// window of up to 20 readings that a replica's cycle moves by about a
// twentieth, so a band under 5 % logged most cycles of a steady fleet; one
// over it missed the slope a load step moves. Not measured on a cluster run.
