// The ITL line on the settle tracker (analyzer-learner.md, section 7, PR
// 4a). The line keeps out of its fits the readings of a replica inside its
// settle (itl.DefaultSteadyFor); when that settle began is now read from the
// engine's settle tracker, through the view k2 reads (settle_view.go). Six
// replay switches, one per named change: the move itself, and five behaviour
// changes.

// SwitchITLReadsSettle is the replay switch for the move (analyzer-learner.md
// 4.1-4.3). On, a replica's settle starts where the settle tracker says: it
// joined, came back past the absence tolerance, was lent or rolled out
// (settle.Replica.Since); load came back after steadyGate.idleRows idle
// rows; or it was Ready again after a row that was not. Off, as before, the
// line's own trace of each replica: a joiner, a return after idleRows rows
// with neither an ITL nor a k, and any replica missing from a cycle or not
// Ready on one. Two rules of the tracker's have switches of their own:
// SwitchITLRestartUnderName and SwitchITLIdleOnEvidence.
//
// One difference is the move's own: to the tracker, a gap between two of a
// model's cycles longer than the absence tolerance is an absence, and the
// replicas settle again (settle.Rejoined); the line's own trace counted an
// absence only by cycles that went without a replica.
const SwitchITLReadsSettle = "itl-reads-the-settle-tracker"

// SwitchITLRestartUnderName is the replay switch for an engine restart under
// the same Pod name, on the tracker. On, a new Ready time under the same
// name starts a settle (settle.Restarted), whether or not a row that was not
// Ready came between. Off, as on the line's own trace, only a row that was
// not Ready shows the restart.
const SwitchITLRestartUnderName = "itl-restart-under-its-name-settles"

// SwitchITLIdleOnEvidence is the replay switch for what an idle row is, on
// the tracker. On, a row is idle only on evidence (settle.Row.Activity: a
// known KV of 0, and a known empty ITL window or a known generation rate of
// 0); a scrape that read nothing neither counts nor breaks an idle run, and
// two idle rows further apart than the absence tolerance make no run. Off,
// as on the line's own trace, a row with neither an ITL nor a k is idle.
const SwitchITLIdleOnEvidence = "itl-idle-needs-evidence"

// SwitchITLWaitsAfterRestart is the replay switch for the line's wait after
// a controller restart (analyzer-learner.md 4.4). On, a replica already
// serving on the line's first cycle waits its settle too, from the
// tracker's first sight of it: the line does not refit for
// steadyGate.steadyFor after a restart. Off, as before, such a replica is
// taken as settled. An analyzer with its own tracker (no engine, a test)
// never waits: it stands for a controller that has watched the fleet.
//
// With SwitchITLReadsSettle off, the line's own trace reads it as "every
// replica on the key's first cycle waits": after a controller restart, but
// also on a key made anew (an operator's forget, new engine arguments),
// where on the tracker a replica settled long before does not wait. Only a
// replay runs that combination.
const SwitchITLWaitsAfterRestart = "itl-waits-after-controller-restart"

// SwitchITLKeepsSettleThroughMissingRow is the replay switch for the
// absence rule (analyzer-learner.md 4.2). On, a replica missing from a
// cycle keeps its settle for up to the tracker's absence tolerance
// (settle.Tolerance): one missed scrape is not a replica that left. Off, as
// before, a replica missing from one cycle starts its settle over.
const SwitchITLKeepsSettleThroughMissingRow = "itl-keeps-the-settle-through-a-missing-row"

// SwitchITLReadsFinitePodMean is the replay switch for what a reading's ITL
// is (analyzer-learner.md 2.3). On, a row is a reading only in the Finite
// state its presence bits give (domain.ReplicaMetrics.ITLState): a Pod with
// an Absent rank, whose AvgITL is its Finite ranks' mean, is refused. Off,
// as before, any finite AvgITL above zero is a reading.
