// SwitchITLOneSidedAtCap is the replay switch for the one-sided price at
// the sequence cap on the ITL line (issue #467; analyzer-learner.md, 4b-3
// round 1, which built it for the throughput line). A replica at its stated
// cap teaches the line from above the band (SwitchBatchCapITLAdmission), at
// a k above itl.DefaultKSat. While the key has no learned B the pinned fit
// pins itl.DefaultBaselineSec, and through readings at a k_cap above kSat it
// prices, at a fill k, A'k + B' + (B0 - B')(1 - k/k_cap): under the truth
// whenever the true B' is above the 6 ms default, so too high a derived mu
// and too few replicas. On, while B is unlearned and the window holds
// readings at k >= kSat, the pinned fit is set against the line through the
// mean of those at or past the pricing k with its intercept an upper prior
// on B (itl.Admission.BPrior: itlBPrior, capped at the window's least ITL),
// compared at the k the line is priced at (pricingK;
// itl.Admission.OneSidedAt), and the higher there is the line. A held slope
// keeps the A that prices the chosen line there. A learned B ends it. Off,
// as before, the fit through the default B is the line.
