// GateGrace is how long a pod may sit at Kueue's admission gate before it
// counts as unplaced: one engine cycle. A pod is gated the moment it is
// created, and Kueue admits a fitting one within a cycle; only one it did not
// admit says the capacity is not there.

// placement counts a variant's unplaced replicas
// (the Kueue borrowing proposal, PR #161, B5): pods the
// scheduler reports Unschedulable, and pods held at Kueue's admission gate for
// longer than GateGrace. A pod pulling an image or loading weights is placed:
// it has a node. On a LeaderWorkerSet a replica is a group, unplaced while any
// of its pods is. since is when the newest unplaced pod became so (the
// Unschedulable condition's transition, or the gated pod's creation), pods
// their names, sorted, and at when each unplaced replica became so: per pod,
// or on a LeaderWorkerSet per group (its group-index label), a group counting
// from when its newest unplaced pod became so. since is the newest, for the
// signals that ask whether anything is newly unplaced; the placement timeout
// reads at (BorrowGovernor.timeoutReleases), so it counts replicas, never the
// pods of one group as several. gated is the part of at held at Kueue's
// admission gate (countGated).
