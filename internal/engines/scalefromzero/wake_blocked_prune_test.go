// that woke by another path, or was deleted, kept wake-no-capacity for the
// life of the process. pruneRefusals clears it, and the extra-pool note, for
// a model that left the groups, and the reason of a model whose decode
// serves again. A model still parked, or serving prefill alone, keeps it.
