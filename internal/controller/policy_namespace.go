// ResolvePolicyNamespace decides where this controller reads limiters and quotas
// from, and records the decision on cfg. It runs once, before the manager starts.
//
// Order:
//
//  1. the wva.llmd.ai/policy-namespace LABEL on the managed Namespace
//  2. the well-known namespace, config.WellKnownPolicyNamespace — self-managed only
//  3. the controller's own namespace
//
// Steps 1 and 2 need `get namespaces`, which a namespace-scoped install's Role
// cannot grant: Namespaces are cluster-scoped. The prereqs phase grants it with a
// per-install ClusterRole (components/policy-namespace-reader). An install
// without that grant still starts on its own ConfigMap, as before, but the source
// is recorded as config.PolicySourceLocalUnverified — logged with the remedy and
// published as wva_policy_namespace_unverified — because "could not look" is not
// "no policy was published".
//
// Rule 1 is an annotation on a NAMESPACE because that object is cluster-scoped: a
// namespace admin holds RBAC inside their namespace and cannot edit it. So an
// admin can direct a controller they did not deploy.
//
// # What this is and is not
//
// This is a GUARDRAIL, not an enforcement boundary, and the distinction is worth
// being blunt about because an earlier version of this function got it wrong.
//
// That version refused to start when a controller managed its own namespace and
// found no policy — reasoning that such a controller is owned by the tenant it is
// supposed to bound, so it must not set its own limits. Both halves of that were
// wrong in practice:
//
//   - it did not work. `selfManaged` is derived from --watch-namespace, an
//     argument on the Deployment the tenant owns. Deleting one flag made the
//     controller look admin-owned and skipped the check entirely. A gate whose
//     trigger is self-reported by its subject is not a gate.
//   - it broke everyone else. Namespace scope is the DEFAULT on OpenShift, so
//     every such install — with no limiter configured and nothing to enforce —
//     would have refused to start until someone created a namespace they had
//     never heard of.
//
// Maximum breakage, zero containment. A tenant who owns the controller's
// Deployment owns its image, so no in-process rule can bind them; a check that
// pretends otherwise mainly misleads the admin relying on it.
//
// Enforcement against a tenant you do not trust belongs at admission, where it
// cannot be argued with: a ResourceQuota on the GPU resource in their namespace.
// What WVA can honestly offer is that the budget is authoritative for every
// controller actually running WVA — which is misconfiguration, drift and copied
// manifests, the things that occur far more often than malice — and, for the
// arrangement where the tenant does NOT own the controller (it runs in an admin
// namespace with WVA_WATCH_NS pointed at theirs), a bound that genuinely holds.
