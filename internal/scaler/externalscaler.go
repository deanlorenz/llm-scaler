//     engine every optimize interval (GLOBAL_OPT_INTERVAL, default 15s) — so an
//     unrefreshed positive decision means nobody is making the claim any more,
//     and the honest answer is to look at the target instead (see
//     currentlyRunning). decisionTTL is at least three publish intervals, so a
//     deployment configuring GLOBAL_OPT_INTERVAL at or above activationTTL (the
//     OpenShift overlay ships 60s) does not expire decisions between publishes.
//
//   - "This should be asleep" (0) never expires. It is the resting state, and
//     expiring it would flip a target that is still draining back to active,
//     flapping against the scale-down that is already in flight.
//
// Note that expiry cannot strand a cold start: as soon as KEDA acts on an
// activation the target has replicas, so the currentlyRunning fallback answers
// "active" on its own. The activation decision only has to outlive KEDA's
// reaction, not the pod's startup.
//
// Scope: both the 0<->1 gate (isActive) and the replica count (GetMetrics) apply
// it, so the two never disagree about whether a decision exists. A stale
