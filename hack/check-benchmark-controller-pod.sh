# Executes the benchmark scripts that read the WVA controller's log against a

#
# They used to select the controller by app.kubernetes.io/name. Warm-pool Pods
# carry that label too, so a pool Pod's log was read as the controller's: its
# lines landed in the captured controller log, in the decision dumps, and in the
# metric-error warning of the two-model verify. The e2e relay Pods carry every
# controller label, control-plane=controller-manager included, so no label
# selector is safe; ownership is (hack/benchmark/controller_pods.py).
#
# The stub serves three Pods that share those labels: the controller, a
# warm-pool Pod and a relay Pod. Each case asserts which Pods a script read the
# log of, and that the controller's lines still arrive. `bash -n` sees none of
# this: the label selector parsed perfectly and selected the wrong Pods.
