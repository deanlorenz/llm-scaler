# Executes the controller readiness check -- wva_controller_rollout_ready, and
# verify_deployment around it -- against a stub kubectl.
#
# `kubectl rollout status` says "successfully rolled out" at once for a
# Deployment scaled to 0, so an install over a controller at 0/0 printed "WVA
# controller is running and ready" and exited 0. That parses perfectly and
# passes on every cluster where the controller is up; only a run against a
# Deployment at 0 replicas shows it.
#
# The stub answers the Deployment lookup with one controller, `rollout status`
# with exit $STUB_ROLLOUT, and the replica read with "$STUB_COUNTS"
# ("<spec.replicas>/<status.readyReplicas>", fields omitted as the API omits
# them); $STUB_COUNTS=FAIL makes that read fail. Every other call succeeds
# with no output, which verify_deployment reads as nothing else to report.
