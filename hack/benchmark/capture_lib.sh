# Shared ownership and argument handling for the benchmark capture helpers.
#
# Sourced by sample_replicas.sh and tail_wva_logs.sh. It is shared because the
# logic lived twice and had already drifted: one script grew an optional
# namespace on stop that the other did not, so the two stop signatures became
# mirror images and getting them backwards silently left a capture running.
#
# THE DESIGN, and why it is this rather than a lock protocol.
#
# Two runs fighting over one output path was the original problem: it produced a
# samples file with two comma-less writers and a sampler whose pidfile had been
# overwritten, so no stop could reach it. The first attempt at a fix was a mutex
# -- mkdir a lock directory, refuse if someone holds it. That needed four things
# to be right at once (an atomic claim-and-record, pid identity, EEXIST versus
# EACCES, process-group teardown) and got each of them wrong once.
#
# So the contention is removed instead of arbitrated: the Makefile gives every
# invocation its own output path, keyed by a run id that is fixed once per `make`
# run. Two concurrent runs cannot collide because they never share a file.
#
# What remains here is not a mutex. It is:
#   - a record of WHO owns a live capture, so a human finding one in /tmp can see
#     its namespace and cluster, and so stop WARNS when the namespace or context
#     it was given does not match. It warns and proceeds: naming a path by hand is
#     taken as meaning it, and refusing would strand a capture whose owner has
#     gone home. It is not a permission check;
#   - an exclusive CREATE of that record, so the degenerate case of two captures
#     aimed by hand at one path still fails safely rather than interleaving;
#   - identity that survives pid reuse, so stop never kills an unrelated process.
