# Continuously capture the WVA controller's own logs for the duration of a
# benchmark run, into a plain file this process controls end to end.
#
# The controller pod's log buffer is bounded by kubelet's fixed per-container
# rotation size (a small, fixed cap unrelated to how much disk the node
# actually has), not by how long the run takes. Any run longer than a few
# minutes -- worse now that k1/k2 decision logging adds real per-cycle
# volume on top of KEDA's own polling chatter -- rotates the very lines
# dump_k2_decisions.py needs, out from under it, often before the run even
# finishes. Tailing continuously from the start and writing to a plain file
# on local disk sidesteps that: once a line has left the pod, the
# container's own rotation no longer matters.
#
# Usage:
#   tail_wva_logs.sh [--context <ctx>] [--force] start <namespace> <outfile>
#   tail_wva_logs.sh [--context <ctx>] stop <namespace> <outfile>
#
# `kubectl logs -f` does not survive the run: the apiserver's load balancer
# resets long-lived streaming connections on an idle-ish timeout regardless of
# how much log volume is flowing (measured on pokprod001: "connection reset by
# peer" at ~15 minutes into an 83-minute run, mid-stream, pod itself never
# restarted). A bare `-f` call that drops silently at that point undoes the
# whole reason this script exists -- 69 minutes of the run's k1/k2 decisions
# were never captured anywhere, kubelet's own rotation having already reclaimed
# the pod's in-container copy. So `start` runs the tail in a reconnect loop:
# on any exit, resume from the last line's own timestamp via --since-time
# rather than from "now", so a drop loses zero lines (just re-fetches the
# handful spanning the reconnect, deduplicated by `stop`).
set -u
# --help prints this file's header comment -- the documentation the script
# already carries, so it cannot drift from what the script does. Placed before
# any argument handling because the commands take a namespace as $1, and without
# it `--help` would be consumed as one.
