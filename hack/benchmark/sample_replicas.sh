# Sample serving replica counts for the duration of a benchmark run.
#
# The harness already writes metrics/processed/replica_status_timeseries.json,
# and on every FMA run measured it came back with snapshots but no controllers:
# collect_metrics.sh filters them with
#
#     model_filter="${LLMDBENCH_HARNESS_STACK_NAME:-}"
#     if model_filter and model != model_filter: continue
#
# comparing a STACK name against the llm-d.ai/model LABEL. Ours are
# "inference-scheduling-wva" and "qwen-qwe-...", which never match, so every
# controller is dropped. The variable cannot be overridden from here either:
# run_only.sh writes it into the harness pod spec from endpoint_stack_name,
# which is also used as --stack, so it cannot simply be set to the model.
#
# Rather than depend on that being fixed upstream, sample it ourselves. The
# result is the same shape the harness produces, so postprocess reads it with
# the same code.
#
# Usage:
#   sample_replicas.sh start <namespace> <outfile>   # backgrounds, writes a pidfile
#   sample_replicas.sh stop  <outfile>               # stops and finalises
set -u
# --help prints this file's header comment -- the documentation the script
# already carries, so it cannot drift from what the script does. Placed before
# any argument handling because several of these take a namespace as $1, and
# without it `--help` was consumed as one.
