# Asserts that every namespace-scoped controller is granted what it needs to
# FIND and READ a published cluster policy, by executing the grant functions
# against a stubbed kubectl.
#
# Two bugs, both silent:
#
#   A. A namespace-scoped controller holds only a Role, which cannot reach a
#      cluster-scoped Namespace. Its lookup of the well-known `wva-policy`
#      namespace was Forbidden, the controller read that as "absent", and ran on
#      its own ConfigMap -- while `make enable-physical-limiter` reported the
#      cluster bounded. Fixed by a Namespace `get` grant: the
#      policy-namespace-reader component (prereqs phase) and
#      pl_grant_namespace_read (enable-physical-limiter), plus a restart for a
#      controller that could not see the namespace when it started.
#   B. A controller installed AFTER the policy was published resolved to it but
#      had no RoleBinding there, and refused to start. Fixed by the prereqs phase
#      granting the read whenever the policy namespace already exists.
#
# What is asserted is what the functions would APPLY, not what their source
# says.
