# That sample has no `limiters:` and names its own namespace. Applied over an
# install, it replaces the `default` entry the installer wrote and silently
# removes the GPU limit: the fleet is unbounded and nothing says so. The docs
# send readers to `kubectl edit` on the installed ConfigMap, or to a re-run of
# the install with WVA_LIMITER, instead.
#
# Only a command line counts (optionally indented, as inside a list item); prose
# that warns against the command names it without starting a line with it.
