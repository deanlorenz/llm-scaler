# Executes post_run_analyze.sh against a stub kubectl and fixture controller
# logs, and asserts the zero-line guard (docs/proposals/analyzer-learner.md
# 6.1): the run window must hold the line the controller logs at its -v,
# replica-capacity-summary at 2 and k2-decision at 3 or more; below 2 neither
# is logged and the analysis says it checked nothing; and a verbosity it
# cannot read fails rather than passes.
#
# Before the guard, only k2-decision was asked for, and only through
# dump_k2_decisions.py, which exits 0 on an empty window. So a run at the
# shipped --v=2, or a log that missed the run, finished as analysed. `bash -n`
# sees none of it.
#
# The analysis steps that do not read the controller log are stubbed; the
# guard, dump_k2_decisions.py and controller_pods.py run as they ship.
