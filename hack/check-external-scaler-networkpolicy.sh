# Renders every shipped overlay and asserts the external-scaler NetworkPolicy
# admits the KEDA external scaler port (:9090) ONLY from KEDA's namespace, while
# every other port the controller serves stays reachable.
#
# The scaler has no authentication of its own by default, and every call
# registers the workload it names with the caller's trigger metadata, so a Pod
# that reaches :9090 can rewrite another tenant's scaler metadata and read any
# decision. The policy is the boundary, and each way of getting it wrong parses
# and applies cleanly:
#
#   a podSelector that matches no controller Pod   policy selects nothing: open
#   a `from:` that is empty, {} or a bare podSelector   open to a namespace or more
#   a controller port with no rule                  metrics or probes go dark
#   the wrong KEDA namespace                        KEDA refused, nothing scales
#
# Then it executes the installer's wva_append_scaler_networkpolicy_patch against
# a STUBBED kubectl, renders the result, and asserts which namespace it chose,
# or that it wrote NO policy (and said :9090 is open) when no trusted source
# knows where KEDA runs -- a guess fails closed wherever it is wrong. Then that
# the policy belongs to the admin phase, and the post-deploy
# wva_verify_scaler_networkpolicy, which compares the policy with where KEDA runs.
