# Design call: what `k2` measures, and why it has to persist

**Status:** Design call — consolidates `issue-v2-k2-rate-anchored.md`,
`k2-rate-solution-explained.md` and `issue-v2-k2-observed-pins-utilization-at-one.md`
into the decisions that need making. No code change proposed here.

## The one-line problem

`k2` is the compute bound in `effectiveCapacity = min(k1, k2)`. It is recorded as
`tokensInUse` at a moment the replica was seen queueing — a **KV stock** — while the
constraint it stands for is a **rate**. On prefill-heavy traffic those are unrelated:
the engine exhausts prompt-token throughput and queues while KV occupancy is still
low, so the analyzer reports abundant headroom on a replica that is already
dropping requests.

Measured: a sustained 1000-input/250-output run queueing and cycling replicas at
**16.2% average KV utilization**. Six threshold/window/policy legs failed to break
the cycling. It is not a tuning problem.

## Why persistence is not optional

This is the constraint that governs the whole design, and it is easy to get
backwards.

For a prefill-heavy workload the true compute bound is far below the memory bound.
`k2` is the only thing that carries that fact. If a learned `k2` is discarded —
aged out, floored upward, or otherwise relaxed toward `k1` — capacity reverts to the
memory bound, which for this workload is a large over-estimate. Then:

> over-stated capacity → utilization reads low → scale-down → requests queue →
> TTFT degrades → scale-up → **but P95/P99 TTFT are already broken**

Tail latency does not recover on the way back up. The replicas return; the damage is
already in the percentile window. Both faces of this are on record: the shed-to-one
at 100/1000 mid-experiment under unchanged load, and the cycling at 1000/250.

**The errors are asymmetric.** Under-estimating `k2` holds more replicas than
strictly needed — it costs money, and nothing is at risk. Over-estimating it breaks
the SLO the autoscaler exists to protect. Every default should therefore be biased
low: a running **minimum**, relaxed upward only slowly, never a floor that pushes
`k2` toward `k1`.

### Two recommendations this retracts

Both were proposed earlier in this repo's issue notes and are wrong for
prefill-heavy workloads. Recording them so they are not re-proposed:

- **"Floor `k2` relative to `k1`"** — raises `k2` toward the memory bound, which is
  precisely the over-estimate that sheds replicas. It would fix a degenerate sample
  by causing the failure the estimator exists to prevent.
- **"Age the history out"** — same direction. Ageing is only safe as the *slow
  upward relaxation* of a running minimum, never as eviction back to `k1`.

## The split the fix needs

```
detector:    rates decide WHEN a replica is at its limit
measurement: tokens record WHAT that limit is
```

A replica is at its limit when it has a backlog at least `QueueLengthThreshold`
deep, **or** when its arrival rate has reached the service rate measured while it
*was* backlogged. At that moment its resident token count measures the limit —
including at 16% occupancy, which is the entire point. The measurement is stored per
workload bucket (model, accelerator, role, GPU count, request shape) as a running
minimum, and every replica of the bucket reads the same value.

### Constraints any implementation must respect

1. **Identical across replicas of a variant.** `aggregateByVariant` takes the median
   of per-replica capacities. A value that varies with each replica's own load is
   not commensurable across siblings — an idle replica's value blends with a
   backlogged one's and can lift variant capacity enough to turn a scale-up into a
   scale-down. A bucket ceiling makes the median a no-op.
2. **Must not move with the current cycle's load.** A capacity recomputed from this
   cycle's arrival rate changes every cycle — an oscillation waiting to happen.
3. **λ and μ are not on the same time base.** A completion happens one residence
   time after the arrival that caused it, so instantaneous λ against a
   completion-derived μ reads as saturation on a replica that is coping during a
   ramp. λ needs smoothing over `AvgTTFT + AvgOutputTokens × AvgITL`.
4. **Sample admission must be strict — because persistence makes bad samples
   permanent.** This constraint is new, and it comes from the degenerate case in
   `issue-v2-k2-observed-pins-utilization-at-one.md`: a replica whose capacity was
   frozen at **2 tokens**, after which utilization never fell below
   `scaleDownBoundary` and the model sat pinned at `maxReplicas`.

   Under a running-**minimum** scheme that failure gets *worse*, not better: a
   spuriously low sample can never be displaced by a higher observation, only by
   age. Queue-depth-alone is a weak detector — a replica that has barely started can
   have a deep queue and almost no residency, and it will happily volunteer a
   near-zero ceiling that then sticks. The rate-based detector is what rejects it:
   a just-started replica has not reached its measured service rate.

   So "persist the minimum" and "admit almost anything as a sample" cannot both
   hold. Strengthening the detector is the price of persistence.

## The safety net (independent of `k2`)

Scale-down asks a question the numbers cannot answer: *would N−1 replicas still
cope?* Demand is measured at the current replica count and does not survive the
change. Arrivals are the one quantity that does not move when replicas do:

```
(replicas × μ)  must stay above  (arrivals ÷ scaleDownBoundary)
```

If removing a replica would break that, it is not removed. This depends on two
measured numbers and no cache, residence or ceiling — so it still holds when the
capacity estimate is wrong. Given the error asymmetry above, this net is arguably
more valuable than the ceiling itself and could ship first.

Two deliberate exceptions: GPU rebalancing ignores it (reclaiming a GPU for a
higher-priority model is exactly the argument the rule should not win), and it is
skipped entirely when any variant in a group has no measured μ, rather than acting
on half the picture.

## Decisions that need a call

1. **Ship order.** The safety net is small, independent, and directly prevents the
   TTFT-breaking shed. The rate-anchored ceiling is the larger correctness fix. Net
   first, ceiling second is the low-risk order — but the net alone leaves the
   estimator still reporting phantom headroom.
2. **Detector strictness.** Keep queue-depth as an admission path, or require the
   rate condition? Strict costs calibration opportunities on fleets that rarely
   queue; loose re-admits the degenerate-sample failure, permanently, under a
   running minimum.
3. **Relaxation policy.** How does a bucket minimum ever move up when a workload
   genuinely gets cheaper? Slow age-based relaxation is the proposal; the rate and
   its interaction with the SLO asymmetry need choosing deliberately.
4. **Bucket key.** Currently `model|accelerator|gpuCount|outputBucket` — no
   namespace, no variant. That looks intentional (capacity as a property of
   model+hardware, matching `lookupCompatibleCapacity`), but it means one deployment
   can set another's ceiling. Confirm or scope it.
5. **P/D disaggregation.** Not addressed by the direction above: μ from the
   generation-tokens histogram is decode-centric; a prefill pool needs
   `rate(vllm:request_prompt_tokens_count[1m])` as its μ.

## Non-goals / already settled

- **No new metrics required.** λ (`inference_extension_scheduler_attempts_total`),
  μ (`vllm:request_generation_tokens_count`), occupancy, queue depth and KV capacity
  are all collected today. Two are registered only when the throughput analyzer is
  enabled, which a fix must not depend on.
- **The ITL model does not cover this.** `ITL(k) = A·k + B` stays flat on
  prefill-heavy traffic while TTFT and the queue explode. It remains the better
  model for decode-bound workloads.
- **A fleet that never queues never calibrates** and falls back to the memory bound.
  Acceptable — nothing is at risk there — but it makes emitting the active
  estimator's source label mandatory rather than optional.

## Regression control

The 300/300 steady case must still hold flat at one replica. A more conservative
capacity estimate is exactly what could turn "correctly holds" into spurious
scale-up, so this is the control, not an afterthought.
