# WVA Cycle Log

The WVA saturation engine emits two structured INFO log lines per reconcile
cycle per model. These lines are the primary observability instrument for
understanding what the analyzer and optimizer computed without enabling
verbose debug logging.

---

## Log lines

### `analyzer-result`

Emitted once per analyzer that ran for a model, immediately after the
universal threshold post-step has been applied — in that analyzer's own
units. **One extra line is emitted for `"CompositeSignal"`**, the signal
actually handed to the optimizer: same schema, its own unit is `%` (coverage
of demand).

| `analyzer` | Unit |
|---|---|
| `saturation` | tokens |
| `throughput` | tokens/sec |
| `CompositeSignal` | % (coverage of demand) |

  ],
  "roleCapacities": []
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `modelID` | WVA model ID (unique within a namespace) |
| `namespace` | Kubernetes namespace |
| `analyzer` | Which line this is: `"saturation"`, `"throughput"`, or `"CompositeSignal"` |
| `score` | This analyzer's fair-share weight (from `AnalyzerScoreConfig`) |
| `live` | Whether this analyzer's result is fresh enough to count against the scale-down veto this cycle |
| `supply` | Total supply across ready replicas (readyCount × perReplicaCapacity), in this line's unit |
| `demand` | Total demand, in this line's unit. For saturation it is the sum of three terms — resident KV tokens, a role-aware projection of requests waiting in each replica's local engine queue, and a model-level, prefix-cache-discounted projection of requests still queued upstream in llm-d flow control (`SchedulerQueue`, not attributed to any variant); see [scaling-policy.md](scaling-policy.md). For `CompositeSignal` this is always `100%` by construction |
| `tokenDemand` | Saturation's own demand, in tokens, carried onto the `CompositeSignal` line as the weight `rescaleInputsForGroup` uses for its priority water-fill — `CompositeSignal`'s own `demand` is always `100%` and can't serve as a weight. `0` on any line other than `CompositeSignal` |
| `tokenRoleDemand` | Per-role breakdown of `tokenDemand`. `null` for a non-disaggregated result or on any line other than `CompositeSignal` |
| `util` | `demand / supply`; > 1.0 means the model is over capacity |
| `rc` | Required capacity signal (post-threshold): > 0 triggers scale-up, in this line's unit |
| `sc` | Spare capacity signal (post-threshold): > 0 permits scale-down, in this line's unit |
| `remaining` | The optimizer's working copy of `rc`, seeded from it and mutated as allocation proceeds within a cycle |
| `spare` | The optimizer's working copy of `sc` |
| `scaleUpThreshold` | Scale-up threshold resolved for this analyzer (from config) |
| `scaleDownBoundary` | Scale-down boundary resolved for this analyzer (from config) |
| `variants[].name` | Variant name |
| `variants[].prc` | Per-replica capacity, in this line's unit |
| `variants[].role` | Resolved P/D role: `prefill`, `decode`, or `both`. Renders as `both` both when the scale target has no `llm-d.ai/role` label and when the analyzer does not populate the role at all. Saturation charges waiting requests by this role, so it is needed to interpret `demand` |
| `variants[].reason` | How the variant's capacity was computed (see below) |
| `roleCapacities[].role` | Role this entry covers (disaggregated models only; empty for non-disaggregated) |
| `roleCapacities[].rc` / `.sc` | Per-role required/spare capacity, in this line's unit |
| `roleCapacities[].roleSpare` | The optimizer's per-role working copy of `sc`, once seeded (omitted before it is) |

If an analyzer does not compute per-variant capacity, `variants` is an empty
array. Multiple `analyzer-result` lines appear per cycle: one per enabled
analyzer, plus one for `CompositeSignal` — all share the same
`modelID`/`namespace` and their own `analyzer` field.

### `scaling-decision`

Emitted once per model after the optimizer has produced its final per-variant
replica targets.

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "msg": "scaling-decision",
  "modelID": "my-model",
  "namespace": "default",
  "decisions": [
    {"name": "primary", "curr": 1, "tgt": 2, "action": "ScaleUp"},
    {"name": "v2",      "curr": 1, "tgt": 1, "action": "NoChange"}
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `modelID` | WVA model ID |
| `namespace` | Kubernetes namespace |
| `decisions[].name` | Variant name |
| `decisions[].curr` | Current replica count at the time of this cycle |
| `decisions[].tgt` | Target replica count chosen by the optimizer |
| `decisions[].action` | `ScaleUp`, `ScaleDown`, or `NoChange` |

## Reason values (`reason` field)

The `reason` field in `analyzer-result` variants is set by each analyzer to
describe how it computed the variant's per-replica capacity. It is free text;
the saturation V2 analyzer sets one of these values:

| Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `P0-store` | capacity came from the **capacity store** (no live replicas) |
| `P1-obs` | k2 came from **observed** tokens-in-use (queue was saturated) |
| `P2-hist` | k2 came from the **historical** rolling average |
| `P3-k2` | k2 was **derived** from deployment parameters (vLLM model args) |
| `P3-prefill` | a **prefill** variant, sized by its per-step batch-token budget. Prefill holds a request only until the first token, so the KV ceiling does not bound it and the decode formula (which assumes a real output length) does not apply |
| `P4-k1` | k2 was unavailable; **fell back** to k1 (memory-bound capacity) |

One further value appears in the `k2-decision` line's `priority` field but never
as a variant's `reason`, because no capacity comes from it:

| value | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `P1-obs-invalid` | an observation was discarded for exceeding the KV cache's **physical** ceiling, i.e. a scrape artifact. Note the bound is the ceiling, not k1: k1 is the ceiling times `kvCacheThreshold` (0.80 by default), so occupancy between the two is legitimate and is kept. The analyzer falls through to the next priority |
| `no-data` | no ready replicas, no stored record, no compatible variant — capacity is 0 this cycle (normal for newly deployed variants) |
| `error` | K2 priority not in known set — indicates an unlabelled code path; should not occur in normal operation |

The `P1-obs`–`P4-k1` values reflect the representative replica for the variant
— specifically the replica whose effective capacity equals the lower median
across all ready replicas (the same replica that determined `prc`). A `P1-obs`
reason means live inference data is available and the capacity estimate is
high-confidence; a `P4-k1` reason means no compute-bound signal was available
for any replica and the estimate is conservative.

The throughput analyzer sets one of these values:

| Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `T1-ols` | capacity from Tier-1 OLS fit (observation window ready) |
| `T2-pinned` | capacity from Tier-2 constrained OLS with a prior fitted B |
| `T2-default` | capacity from Tier-2 constrained OLS with the default baseline B (cold start) |
| `T2-failed` | both tiers failed — all replicas idle or no usable ITL signal; variant skipped this cycle |

Other analyzers may set their own reason values or leave `reason` empty.

## Grep patterns

```bash
# All analyzer results for a specific model
kubectl logs <pod> | grep '"msg":"analyzer-result"' | grep '"modelID":"my-model"'

# Saturation analyzer only
kubectl logs <pod> | grep '"msg":"analyzer-result"' | grep '"analyzer":"saturation"'

# The composite signal actually sent to the optimizer
kubectl logs <pod> | grep '"msg":"analyzer-result"' | grep '"analyzer":"CompositeSignal"'

# Scaling decisions only (scale-up events)
kubectl logs <pod> | grep '"msg":"scaling-decision"' | grep '"action":"ScaleUp"'

# Full cycle for one model (both lines)
kubectl logs <pod> | grep -E '"analyzer-result"|"scaling-decision"' | grep '"modelID":"my-model"'
```

---

## Ordering and timing

Within a single reconcile cycle for one model:

1. One `analyzer-result` line per enabled analyzer (saturation first, then
   any registered non-saturation analyzers in registration order).
2. One more `analyzer-result` line for `CompositeSignal`.
3. One `scaling-decision` line after the optimizer has processed all models
   in the cycle.

The two line types are not atomically adjacent in the log — other models'
`analyzer-result` lines may appear between a model's last `analyzer-result`
and its `scaling-decision`. Filter by `modelID` and `namespace` when
correlating them.

## Enabling the log

These lines are emitted at INFO level and appear in the default controller
log output. No feature flag or configuration change is required.
