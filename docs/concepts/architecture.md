# How the scaling manager fits together

llm-scaling-manager decides how many replicas each LLM model server should run.
It reads how loaded the servers are, works out the replica count every model
needs, keeps the total inside a GPU budget if you set one, and hands the
number to KEDA. KEDA and the Kubernetes HPA do the actual scaling; the scaling
manager never changes a replica count itself.

![Where the scaling manager sits: clients reach model servers through the llm-d gateway and EPP; Prometheus scrapes the servers; the scaling manager reads Prometheus and the EPP queue, applies the scaling policy and an optional GPU budget, and answers KEDA, whose HPA scales the workload](figures/how-it-fits.svg)

## The parts, left to right

- **The serving path is llm-d's.** Clients send requests to a gateway. The
  EPP (endpoint picker, llm-d's router) chooses a replica for each request,
  and queues requests when every replica is busy. The model servers are vLLM
  or SGLang pods, run by a Deployment or a LeaderWorkerSet.
- **Prometheus** scrapes the model servers (KV-cache use, running and waiting
  requests, token counts, latency) and the EPP (its queue and arrival rate).
- **The scaling manager** is one Deployment, `wva-controller-manager`. Every
  15 seconds it reads those metrics from Prometheus. For a model parked at zero
  replicas it also reads the EPP's queue directly, so a waiting request wakes
  the model at once. Its settings (thresholds, tiers, limiters) live in the
  `wva-scaling-policy-config` ConfigMap and are re-read without a restart
  (except by a namespace-scoped controller whose policy ConfigMap is outside
  the namespace it manages: that one reads it at startup).
- **The GPU budget is optional.** Without one, each model is sized on its own.
  With one, every decision has to fit: the GPUs physically free on the
  cluster, a quota you declare, or a quota read from Kueue.
- **KEDA** asks the scaling manager for each variant's replica count over gRPC
  (the `wva-external-scaler` Service, port 9090). The HPA that KEDA creates
  reads the count and scales the workload to it.

## The unit it scales: one ScaledObject per variant

A **model** is what clients ask for by name. A **variant** is one way of
serving it, such as one GPU type or one serving configuration. Each variant
is one KEDA ScaledObject plus the workload it scales. Variants whose triggers
name the same `modelID` are sized together, as one model.

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: llama-8b-h100
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: llama-8b-h100          # the Deployment (or LeaderWorkerSet) to scale
  minReplicaCount: 1
  maxReplicaCount: 8
  triggers:
    - type: external-push
      metadata:
        scalerAddress: wva-external-scaler.<controller-namespace>.svc.cluster.local:9090
        modelID: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
        variantCost: "10"        # relative cost of one replica of this variant
```

You rarely write this by hand: `make scaledobjects-plan` lists the model
servers it finds and writes a plan to edit, and `make scaledobjects-apply`
creates the ScaledObjects. Creating the ScaledObject is the whole
registration; there is no other custom resource.

## One decision cycle

![The five steps of one cycle: collect, analyze, decide inside the GPU budget, scale to zero, publish; how KEDA reads the result; and the scale-from-zero engine beside it](figures/decision-cycle.svg)

1. **Collect.** From Prometheus, per replica: KV-cache use, running and
   waiting requests, token rates. Per model: the router's queue and arrival
   rate.
2. **Analyze.** The saturation analyzer works out how full each replica is
   and how much capacity the model needs for its load. Throughput and custom
   analyzers, when enabled, report metrics (`wva_analyzer_demand`,
   `wva_analyzer_target`) but are not passed to the optimizer, so they do not
   change the decision.
3. **Decide.** The optimizer splits that capacity across the model's
   variants. With no limiter it grows the variant with the lowest cost per
   unit of capacity (`variantCost` over what one replica serves) first. With
   a limiter, the GPU budget for this cycle (free GPUs, a quota, or Kueue
   quotas) is an input, and every model is fitted inside it by score. The
   [utilization-share optimizer](../well-lit-paths/utilization-share/)
   (experimental) then moves GPUs between the models of one quota.
4. **Scale to zero.** If enabled, a model with no requests for its retention
   period is set to zero.
5. **Publish.** Each ScaledObject's replica count is kept in memory for KEDA,
   with an Event on the ScaledObject when it changes, and metrics.

**How KEDA gets the number.** The HPA that KEDA created reads it through
`GetMetrics` on its own sync period; the metric's target is 1, so the replica
count is the number returned. The push stream (`StreamIsActive`) carries only
whether a variant is active, which is what takes it off zero.

**Beside the cycle, the scale-from-zero engine** checks every 100 ms whether a
model at zero has requests waiting in its EPP's queue, read directly from the
EPP. If it has, and the GPU budget allows, it sets one replica, and the push
stream wakes KEDA at once instead of on its next poll.

How each step decides, in detail: [the steady-state
engine](steady-state-engine.md) and [modeling and
optimization](modeling-and-optimization.md).

## Inside the scaling manager

![The components inside the controller: what it reads (policy, the ScaledObjects KEDA asks about, Prometheus, GPU usage, Kueue, each pool's EPP), the steady-state engine's stages, the scale-from-zero engine, the warm pool, and what it writes (the decision store served to KEDA over gRPC, metrics, Events, pod annotations, the history ConfigMap)](figures/internal-architecture.svg)

- **It learns its workloads from KEDA.** Each call KEDA makes for a
  ScaledObject registers that ScaledObject; there is no list or watch of your
  workloads. It does watch the scaling-policy ConfigMaps and the
  InferencePools, to find each pool's EPP.
- **One replica decides.** With more than one replica, leader election picks
  one, and only it runs the engines. The external scaler runs on every
  replica, but answers KEDA only once its replica is the leader.
- **The decision lives in memory**, in the decision store, and is rebuilt
  within one cycle after a restart. Until then KEDA is answered each target's
  current replica count, read from its `scale` subresource, so the HPA holds
  every variant where it is: see
  [before the first decision](../reference/scaledobject-trigger.md#before-the-first-decision-and-the-fallback).
- **Package by package**, for contributors: [which component owns which
  number](../developer-guide/signal-dataflow.md).

## What gets installed

| Object | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| Deployment `wva-controller-manager` | the scaling manager |
| Service `wva-external-scaler`, port 9090 | where KEDA asks for replica counts |
| Service `wva-controller-manager-metrics-service`, port 8443 | its own `wva_*` metrics, for Prometheus |
| ConfigMap `wva-scaling-policy-config` | thresholds, tiers, limiters; re-read live (at startup only, for a namespace-scoped controller reading it outside the namespace it manages) |
| ConfigMap `wva-manager-config` | Prometheus address and the cycle interval; changes need a restart |
| Roles and ClusterRoles | read pods, workloads, ScaledObjects, InferencePools, nodes and (optionally) Kueue queues; patch pods |

It has **no write access** to Deployments, ScaledObjects or HPAs. It patches
pods: annotations (the deletion cost that tells Kubernetes which pod to remove
first, and the marks of the utilization-share optimizer) and, with a warm pool,
the labels that put a pool pod into a model's InferencePool. It also writes
Events, a leader-election Lease and its own ConfigMaps.
Every identity, permission and port, by install scope: [security model](../reference/security-model.md).

The common install is **namespace-scoped**: one scaling manager per namespace,
managing only the model servers there. A cluster admin runs a one-time setup
for the cluster-wide pieces first. Both steps are in [install in a
namespace](../guides/install-in-namespace/). A [cluster-wide
install](../guides/install-cluster-wide/) runs one controller for every
namespace. A cluster admin can also publish one policy in the `wva-policy`
namespace, which self-managed controllers read in place of their own. Two
kinds do not read it: a namespace-scoped controller on Kubernetes without the
Namespace read `make setup-prereqs` grants (it keeps its own ConfigMap and
reports `wva_policy_namespace_unverified`), and admin-owned controllers (cluster-scoped, or out of the tenant's reach) read
their own ConfigMap by design, which the admin's command writes for them.
Each controller logs which source it took at startup: [bound every install by
real GPUs](../guides/admin-gpu-bounding/).

## What it writes back

- **Metrics**, all named `wva_*`: desired and current replicas, saturation,
  GPU use, why a model is held back. The [monitoring
  page](../reference/monitoring.md) lists the ones that answer specific
  questions.
- **Events** on each ScaledObject: `ScaledUp`, `ScaledDown`, `ScaledToZero`,
  `ResourceConstrained`, `MetricsUnavailable`, and more.
- **Two log lines per model per cycle**, which say why it decided what it
  did: [the cycle log](../reference/cycle-log.md).

## Optional pieces

| Piece | What it does | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scale to zero | parks an idle model at zero replicas and wakes it when a request queues | [path](../well-lit-paths/scale-to-zero/) |
| Warm pool | keeps models loaded and asleep, and lends one to a variant while its own replica starts | [path](../well-lit-paths/warm-pool-bridge/) |
| GPU limiter | bounds every decision by the GPUs that are free (`gpu-inventory`; logged as `inventory`) | [path](../well-lit-paths/bound-by-gpus/) |
| Quota limiter | bounds each namespace, or the cluster, by a declared allowance | [path](../well-lit-paths/tenant-gpu-quotas/) |
| Kueue quotas | takes that allowance from Kueue's ClusterQueues (experimental) | [path](../well-lit-paths/kueue-bounded-quotas/) |
| Faster replica start | pre-pulls images, keeps weights and compile caches on each node | [preparing a workload](../reference/workload-preparation.md) |
