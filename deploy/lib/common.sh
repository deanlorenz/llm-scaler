#                       everything the controller has.
# ServiceAccount and Secret are here for the ServiceMonitor's sake, and the
# ordering is the whole point.
#
# On OPENSHIFT the ServiceMonitor authenticates with `bearerTokenSecret:
# wva-metrics-scraper-token`. (On Kubernetes it uses `bearerTokenFile` -- a
# projected service-account token the kubelet supplies -- so there is no Secret
# for the operator to resolve and this failure cannot occur there. The kinds move
# on both platforms anyway: the objects reference each other on both, and one
# phase boundary is easier to reason about than a per-platform one.) The prometheus-operator resolves that Secret when
# it first sees the ServiceMonitor, and if the Secret is absent it REJECTS the
# object -- `reason=InvalidConfiguration`, "unable to get secret" -- and does not
# retry when the Secret later appears. Nothing re-evaluates it: a metadata write
# is not enough, and re-running this phase applies identical content, so
# `kubectl apply` reports "unchanged" and the operator never looks again.
#
# With the Secret in the CONTROLLER phase, the two-phase install therefore created
# the ServiceMonitor 33 minutes before the Secret it needs, and WVA's own metrics
# were permanently uncollected -- no `up` series, no `wva_*` series -- while every
# install step reported success. Measured on pokprod001: the install said
# "All components verified successfully!" and Thanos had nothing.
#
# The single-command install (INSTALL_PHASE=all) was unaffected, because it applies
# everything at once and the render orders Secret before ServiceMonitor. That is
# why this survived: it is the two-person split, the shape the guides recommend,
# that breaks. The two namespaces on that cluster running this code with working
# metrics both had their Secret created 3 seconds BEFORE their ServiceMonitor.
#
# Both kinds belong to an admin anyway -- they are namespaced, and creating them
# needs no rights a namespace owner lacks, but they are part of the same
# monitoring wiring the ServiceMonitor is. Moving them here keeps the three
# objects that reference each other in one phase, applied in render order, which
# puts ServiceAccount and Secret ahead of ServiceMonitor.
#
# This list also drives the phase-2 gate (wva_rendered_prereq_objects), so the
# controller phase now checks for them and names them if an admin's phase 1
# predates this change.
#
# Note the filter matches on KIND alone -- it cannot name objects. Every
# ServiceAccount and Secret in the render is therefore admin-owned, today the
# two controller/epp-metrics ServiceAccounts and their service-account-token
# Secrets, which is what is wanted. A Secret added to the base later becomes
# admin-owned silently, and a tenant would meet it as a missing prerequisite at
# phase 2 rather than as anything more obvious. Adding one means deciding which
# phase owns it.
WVA_PREREQ_KINDS=(Namespace ClusterRole ClusterRoleBinding ServiceMonitor Role RoleBinding ServiceAccount Secret)

# wva_prereq_kind_filter echoes a yq expression selecting (or with $1=exclude,
# rejecting) the admin-owned kinds. One definition, so the prereqs phase and the
# controller phase cannot disagree about where the line is and leave a kind that
# neither applies.
# WVA_PREREQ_NAMED are objects the prereqs phase owns BY NAME, for kinds it does
# not own wholesale.
#
# Only wva-metrics-server-ca, and it has to be here: the ServiceMonitor above is
# admin-owned and references this ConfigMap as its `ca`. The prometheus-operator
# resolves that the moment the ServiceMonitor appears and REJECTS it if the
# ConfigMap is absent, then never reconsiders -- so a two-phase install created
# the monitor in phase 1, the ConfigMap in phase 2, and left a standing rejection:
#
#   failed to get ca "<configmap=wva-metrics-server-ca,key=service-ca.crt>":
#   configmaps "wva-metrics-server-ca" not found
#
# with no scrape target, no wva_* series, and a dashboard whose WVA panels are
# empty while its vllm:* panels fill. Exactly the failure #1516 fixed for the
# ServiceMonitor's Secret; the CA was missed because it is a different kind.
#
# By NAME rather than by kind, because the overlay renders three ConfigMaps and
# the other two are the tenant's: wva-manager-config and, especially,
# wva-scaling-policy-config, which a namespace owner is meant to edit. Making
# every ConfigMap admin-owned to fix one of them would take the scaling policy
# with it.
#
# NetworkPolicy/wva-external-scaler is here for a different reason: it must name
# the namespace KEDA runs in, and only the admin's phase can read that (the
# external.metrics APIService is cluster-scoped). Applied from the tenant's
# phase it was always a guess -- keda-system -- and with KEDA in `keda` it
# refused KEDA and nothing scaled. The tenant phase now neither writes nor
# requires it: wva_missing_prereqs reports it OPTIONAL, because an admin phase
# that could not find KEDA leaves it out on purpose
# (wva_append_scaler_networkpolicy_patch) rather than write a guess.

# wva_resolve_namespace points a namespace-scoped install at NAMESPACE when the

# scope once WVA_SCOPE is empty and the platform default applies. The make-side
# version reached only the 12 phase targets, so `NAMESPACE=x make

# meant to undo had gone to x.
#

# wva_bootstrap_env gives a caller that sources these libraries directly — rather

#
# The targets that plan and apply ScaledObjects do exactly that, so none of

# `export NAMESPACE=…` entirely. The plan then scanned the wrong namespace and
# found nothing, or — worse, because it looks like it worked — wrote every trigger
# with a scaler address in a namespace where no scaler runs. KEDA reports that as
# a failing trigger on a healthy-looking install, which reads as "WVA is broken"
# rather than "WVA was handed the wrong address".

#                `kubectl apply -f admin.yaml`
#
# How: wva_render_init replaces `kubectl` and `helm` with the shell functions
# below, the same mechanism WVA_KUBE_CONTEXT uses, so every call in the admin
# phase goes through one place and no call site knows about rendering. Reads
# go to the cluster. Writes are captured: an apply or create becomes an object
# in a local store, a patch or label of a stored object is applied to the
# stored copy, and anything else is recorded as a command. Later reads of a
# stored object are answered from the store, so the phase sees its own writes
# as it would on the cluster. A Helm install it records also answers the reads
# that only the installed chart could (its CRDs, KEDA's API), so the decisions
# after it are the live run's.
#
# Permission questions about the caller (`kubectl auth can-i` without --as) are
# answered yes: they ask what the person who runs admin.sh may do, and that is
# a cluster admin. A render therefore needs read rights only. Waits and rollout
# checks on objects that were only rendered are skipped and say so.
#
# A PATH shim catches any child process that calls kubectl or helm directly and
# refuses its writes, so a render can never write to the cluster.

# wva_render_active reports whether this run renders instead of applying.
