# Which nodes are the accelerator nodes -- for the per-node DaemonSets
# (deploy/prepull.sh, and whatever follows it) that have to land on every
# node a model server could be scheduled to.
#
# "Has a GPU" is not one label. NVIDIA GPU Feature Discovery writes
# nvidia.com/gpu.product (and nvidia.com/gpu.present); CoreWeave, GKE, EKS
# Auto Mode, Karpenter and the AMD operator each write their own key, and on
# those clusters a DaemonSet selecting on the GFD key runs on NO node while
# the model servers, which select on nothing, schedule to every GPU node.
# So the default is not a nodeSelector but a node affinity with one term per
# known product-label key -- terms are OR-ed, which a nodeSelector cannot
# express -- and the node listing filters on the same keys. Each term is
# "the key exists AND is not empty": CoreWeave writes gpu.nvidia.com/model=""
# on its CPU nodes, and Exists alone put a holder on four of them. An
# explicit selector replaces both: one or more KEY=VALUE pairs separated by
# commas, every one of which a node must carry (a nodeSelector map, and the
# equality-only form of a `kubectl get nodes -l` selector). More than one
# pair is how a cluster where no single label picks out the usable GPU
# nodes -- the one label that would exclude a broken node is also on the
# CPU nodes -- narrows them: the product label AND that one.
#
# What places the model servers is their accelerator RESOURCE request, not
# a label; these keys are the labels that say a node has one. On a cluster
# mixing vendors the default lands a CUDA image on an AMD, Intel or Gaudi
# node too -- disk spent where the engine can never run -- which is why
# `status` names the key each node matched and warns on those, and why
# --node-selector is the answer there.
#
# The key list is the one deploy/lib/accelerator_labels.py and the
# controller resolve through; hack/check-accelerator-labels.sh fails when
# any copy drifts from the others.

# Keys whose presence on a node says an accelerator is there. Order is the
# canonical GFD key first, as in the other copies.
